## What "CSV Cross-Reference" Actually Means

I wasn't making it up, but I wasn't explaining it clearly. Here's the truth:

### The Parquet Problem

**During the Rust processing pipeline (CSV → Parquet), some columns were dropped.**

Specifically:

| Data Type | CSV File | Has in CSV | Parquet File | Has in Parquet |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| SCED Load | `60d_Load_Resource_Data_in_SCED-*.csv` | ✅ "Resource Name" | `SCED_Load_Resources/2024.parquet` | ❌ **MISSING** |
| DAM Energy Bids | `60d_DAM_EnergyBidAwards-*.csv` | ✅ Full data | No parquet exists | ❌ **NOT PROCESSED** |

### What This Means

**"CSV Cross-Reference"** = Going back to the original CSV files because the parquet files are incomplete.

It's not magic or complicated - it's just:
1. Parquet is missing data we need
2. CSV has the data
3. We need to read the CSV files directly

## DAM Charging - The Complete Truth

### You Were 100% Right

Batteries ABSOLUTELY can and do charge in the day-ahead market. I was wrong to say they can't.

### Where DAM Charging Data Lives

**File**: `60d_DAM_EnergyBidAwards-*.csv` (exists in CSV, NOT processed to parquet)

**Structure**:
```csv
"Delivery Date","Hour Ending","Settlement Point","QSE Name","Energy Only Bid Award in MW","Settlement Point Price","Bid ID"
"11/02/2023","1","ALVIN_RN","QPEBSE","-2","19.64","NTL06"
```

**Key Points**:
1. ✅ Data exists (I found the files)
2. ✅ Negative awards = charging (e.g., -2 MW = charging 2 MW)
3. ⚠️ Data is at **SETTLEMENT POINT** level, not resource level
4. ❌ NOT processed to parquet (your Rust pipeline hasn't ingested this file type yet)

### The Attribution Problem

Unlike Gen/Load Resource files which have explicit resource names, Energy Bid Awards only have:
- Settlement Point (e.g., "BATCAVE_RN")
- QSE Name (the market participant)
- Award Amount (negative = charging)

**Challenge**: If multiple resources share a settlement point, how do we know which one got the award?

**Solutions**:
1. **Simple assumption**: If BESS is the only resource at that settlement point, attribute all awards to it
2. **QSE matching**: Match QSE name to resource owner (requires QSE → Resource mapping)
3. **Proportion by capacity**: Split awards based on resource capacity at that SP

## RT Charging - The Complete Truth

### The Parquet Issue

**SCED_Load_Resources/2024.parquet** was created by your Rust processor, but **it dropped the "Resource Name" column**.

**What's in parquet**:
- `SCEDTimeStamp` ✅
- `BasePoint` (the charging MW) ✅
- `MaxPowerConsumption` ✅
- `ResourceName` ❌ **MISSING**

**What's in CSV**:
- All the above columns ✅
- "Resource Name" ✅ **PRESENT**

### Why This Happened

Looking at the parquet schema selection in your Rust code, it looks like during processing:
- The column name mapping might have missed "Resource Name"
- Or it was intentionally excluded to save space
- The parquet has 19M rows, so maybe a size optimization

### The "CSV Cross-Reference" Solution

**Option A - Direct CSV Read**:
```python
# For each BESS Load Resource (e.g., BATCAVE_LD1):
csv_files = glob('/path/to/60d_Load_Resource_Data_in_SCED-*-24.csv')
all_data = []
for csv in csv_files:
    df = pd.read_csv(csv)
    bess_data = df[df['Resource Name'] == 'BATCAVE_LD1']
    all_data.append(bess_data[['SCED Time Stamp', 'Base Point']])
```

**Option B - Match Parquet to CSV**:
```python
# Load parquet (fast, no Resource Name)
parquet_df = pd.read_parquet('SCED_Load_Resources/2024.parquet')

# Load one CSV file to create mapping
csv_sample = pd.read_csv('60d_Load_Resource_Data_in_SCED-24-JUL-24.csv')

# Match using unique combination
matches = pd.merge(
    parquet_df,
    csv_sample[['SCED Time Stamp', 'Max Power Consumption', 'Base Point', 'Resource Name']],
    on=['SCED Time Stamp', 'Max Power Consumption', 'Base Point']
)
```

**Option C - Fix the Parquet (Best Long-Term)**:
```rust
// Update your Rust processor to include Resource Name
// Re-run the SCED Load Resources processing
// Takes ~30 min to regenerate parquet with proper columns
```

## Complete Data Availability Matrix

| Revenue Component | Data Location | Format | Status | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|--------|--------|-------|
| **DAM Discharge** | DAM_Gen_Resources/2024.parquet | Parquet | ✅ Ready | AwardedQuantity column |
| **DAM Charging** | 60d_DAM_EnergyBidAwards-*.csv | CSV only | ⚠️ Needs work | At Settlement Point level |
| **DAM AS (Gen)** | DAM_Gen_Resources/2024.parquet | Parquet | ✅ Ready | RegUp/Down/RRS/ECRS/NonSpin |
| **DAM AS (Load)** | DAM_Load_Resources/2024.parquet | Parquet | ✅ Ready | Same AS services |
| **RT Discharge** | SCED_Gen_Resources/2024.parquet | Parquet | ✅ Ready | BasePoint column |
| **RT Charging** | 60d_Load_Resource_Data_in_SCED-*.csv | CSV only | ⚠️ Needs work | Parquet missing ResourceName |
| **DA Prices** | DAM_Gen_Resources (embedded) or DA_prices | Parquet | ✅ Ready | EnergySettlementPointPrice |
| **RT Prices** | RT_prices/2024.parquet | Parquet | ✅ Ready | 15-min or 5-min intervals |
| **AS Prices** | AS_prices/2024.parquet | Parquet | ✅ Ready | MCPC by service type |

## Implementation Options (Realistic Effort)

### Option 1: Parquet-Only (Incomplete but Fast)
**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Calculates**:
- ✅ DAM discharge revenue
- ✅ DAM AS revenue (Gen + Load)
- ✅ RT discharge revenue
- ❌ DAM charging cost (missing)
- ❌ RT charging cost (missing)

**Result**: Revenue OVERSTATED by 20-50% (no charging costs)

**Use Case**: Quick top 10 ranking, understanding AS revenue contribution

---

### Option 2: Add CSV for RT Charging
**Time**: +3-4 hours
**Calculates**: Everything in Option 1 PLUS:
- ✅ RT charging cost (from CSV)

**Result**: RT market accurate, DAM market still overstated

**Use Case**: If you believe most charging happens RT (common for BESS)

---

### Option 3: Add DAM Energy Bid Awards
**Time**: +4-6 hours
**Calculates**: Everything in Option 2 PLUS:
- ✅ DAM charging cost (from Energy Bid Awards)

**Complexity**: Need to handle settlement point attribution

**Result**: Fully accurate revenue calculation

**Use Case**: Complete analysis for business decisions

---

### Option 4: Fix Parquet + Process Energy Bids (Best)
**Time**: ~8 hours (includes Rust code updates)
**Tasks**:
1. Update Rust processor to keep ResourceName in SCED_Load_Resources
2. Add processor for DAM_EnergyBidAwards files
3. Re-run processing for 2024
4. Write calculator using all parquet data

**Result**: Clean, fast, complete analysis. Reusable for future years.

**Use Case**: Production-quality implementation

## My Honest Recommendation

**Phase 1** (Today - 3 hours):
```python
# Calculate what we CAN from parquet:
- DAM discharge + AS revenue (both Gen and Load)
- RT discharge revenue
- Output: Gross revenue per BESS
```

**Phase 2** (Tomorrow - 4 hours):
```python
# Add RT charging from CSV:
- Read SCED Load CSV files for each BESS Load Resource
- Calculate RT charging cost
- Output: Net RT revenue per BESS
```

**Phase 3** (If needed - 6 hours):
```python
# Add DAM charging from Energy Bid Awards:
- Process Energy Bid Award CSV files
- Attribute to BESS by settlement point
- Output: Complete revenue picture
```

**Phase 4** (Future - 8 hours):
```
# Fix the data pipeline:
- Update Rust processor
- Regenerate parquet files
- Write clean calculator
```

## The Bottom Line

1. **I was NOT making things up** - the data gaps are real
2. **You were RIGHT** - batteries absolutely charge in DAM
3. **The data EXISTS** - it's in CSV files
4. **The parquet is INCOMPLETE** - some columns dropped during processing
5. **We CAN calculate everything** - just need to access CSV for the gaps

The question is: **How much accuracy do you need vs. how fast do you need results?**
