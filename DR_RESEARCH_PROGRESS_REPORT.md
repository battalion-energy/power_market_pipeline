## Key Insights from Research

### 1. Payment Structure Patterns

**Capacity-Only Programs (5):**
- Entergy AILC: $20-100/month by horsepower tier
- SWEPCO: $30/kW
- SCE Summer Discount: $10-145/year per A/C unit

**Capacity + Performance (3):**
- LADWP: $10-15/kW/month + $0.25/kWh
- PG&E CBP: Variable capacity + natural gas-indexed energy
- MISO: $666.50/MW-day (2025 summer) + energy when dispatched

**Performance-Only (1):**
- TVA Peak Rewards: Seasonal payments (rates not public)

**No Incentives (1):**
- SCE OBMC: Rotating outage exemption only

### 2. Event Frequency Reality

**Actual vs Maximum Allowed:**
- MISO LMR: 0-3 events/year actual vs 16 maximum
- LADWP: 3 events in 2023 vs 20 maximum
- Entergy AILC: 3-4 events/year vs 15 maximum
- TVA: Conservative dispatch, 32 hours/year maximum

**Key Finding:** Most programs dispatch far less than maximum allowed, creating good revenue predictability.

### 3. Technology Integration

**API-Enabled (2 programs):**
- PG&E CBP: OpenADR 2.0b
- SCE programs: Integration via CAISO PDR

**Direct Control (3 programs):**
- Entergy Smart DLC: Thermostat control
- SCE Summer Discount: A/C cycling device
- Entergy AILC: Remote disconnect switch

**Self-Dispatch (6 programs):**
- Customers manage their own curtailment

### 4. Market Integration

**CAISO-Integrated (3 CA programs):**
- PG&E CBP: Full PDR model
- SCE Summer Discount: PDR aggregation
- SCE OBMC: Stage 3 emergency response

**MISO-Integrated (1 program):**
- Multiple participation pathways (LMR, DRR, reserves)

**Utility-Only (7 programs):**
- Traditional utility dispatch model
