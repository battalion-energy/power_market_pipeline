  "description": "Xcel Energy's Peak Partner Rewards is a voluntary demand response program for business customers in Colorado that provides financial incentives for reducing electricity usage during peak demand periods. Participants earn monthly capacity credits for committed load reductions of as little as 25 kW, plus additional performance payments when events are called. The program helps manage grid demand primarily during summer months between 12 p.m. and 8 p.m., with events lasting up to four hours. Customers receive at least one hour advance notification by phone, SMS, and email. Year-round credits can add up to thousands of dollars in annual savings, making it an accessible program for small to medium-sized businesses willing to curtail operations during peak periods.",

    "confidence_level": "moderate-high",
    "confidence_explanation": "Moderate-high confidence in core program parameters (capacity payment rate, minimum capacity, event frequency/duration, notification period, general seasonal pattern) due to confirmation across multiple independent sources including U.S. DOE FEMP database and Xcel Energy official website. Lower confidence in: (1) exact performance payment rate due to conflicting sources, (2) baseline and M&V procedures due to lack of public documentation, (3) penalty structure due to no information available, (4) exact call window timing due to minor source variations. Inability to access official PDF program documents directly limits confidence - relied on secondary sources and web summaries. Overall program structure and financial incentives appear reliable, but operational details require direct verification with Xcel Energy for optimization planning and enrollment."
