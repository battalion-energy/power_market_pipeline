Term-DLM is a day-ahead peak-shaving program requiring 21 hours or more advance notice, while Auto-DLM requires rapid 10-minute response capability. Both programs were established in September 2020 by the NY Public Service Commission to provide fixed pricing for 3-5 year contract terms, encouraging investment in battery storage and clean energy technologies. National Grid contracts directly with Curtailment Service Providers (CSPs) or individual customers for multi-year terms.",
