  "description": "This is a STANDBY SERVICE TARIFF for non-residential customers with on-site generation facilities up to 80 MW, NOT a demand response program. The tariff provides backup power service from Duke Energy when the customer's on-site generation is unavailable or insufficient. Customers with on-site generation (solar, backup generators, CHP, etc.) pay standby charges to ensure grid power is available when their generation is offline. This is fundamentally different from demand response programs which compensate customers for reducing load or providing grid services.",

  "research_notes": "CRITICAL FINDINGS:\n\n1. PROGRAM MISCLASSIFICATION: The 'On-Site Generation Service Program' is NOT a demand response program. It is a STANDBY SERVICE TARIFF for customers with on-site generation who need backup utility service.\n\n2. PAYMENT DIRECTION: This tariff involves customers PAYING Duke Energy for standby service availability, not Duke Energy compensating customers for grid services. This is the opposite of a demand response program.\n\n3. STANDBY SERVICE DEFINITION: When customers install on-site generation (solar, backup generators, CHP, batteries), they typically still need utility backup for when their generation is offline or insufficient. The utility charges 'standby charges' to maintain this backup capacity available. This is an interconnection/rate design issue, not a DR program.\n\n4. ACTUAL DR PROGRAMS IN SOUTH CAROLINA: Duke Energy Carolinas operates two actual demand response programs in SC:\n   - Power Manager (residential load control)\n   - PowerShare (commercial/industrial load curtailment)\n\n5. POWERSHARE DETAILS: PowerShare is the relevant DR program for battery systems:\n   - Commercial/industrial voluntary load curtailment\n   - $5/kW capacity credit (increased from $3.50/kW effective August 1, 2025)\n   - Approved by SC Public Service Commission\n   - Tariff schedule: PS - Powershare Non-Residential Load Curtailment Rider\n\n6. BATTERY IMPLICATIONS:\n   - For STANDBY SERVICE TARIFF: Battery systems >100 kW with >60% capacity factor may incur standby charges (a cost, not revenue)\n   - For POWERSHARE DR PROGRAM: Battery systems can participate for revenue by discharging during events to reduce customer load\n   - Typical battery capacity factors (10-30%) usually below 60% threshold for standby charges\n\n7. REVENUE OPPORTUNITY: PowerShare offers approximately $60,000/year in capacity revenue for 1 MW battery (assuming $5/kW monthly structure). Event-based energy payments would add to this but details not available.\n\n8. DATA QUALITY: Research successfully identified program misclassification and located actual DR programs. PowerShare rate confirmed from official press releases. Full tariff documents not accessible through web tools but program structure and rates verified.\n\n9. RECOMMENDATION: For battery optimization analysis, EXCLUDE this standby service tariff and INCLUDE Duke Energy PowerShare commercial/industrial demand response program instead.\n\n10. TARIFF SYSTEM: Duke Energy Carolinas maintains complete tariff schedules in SC PSC eTariff System (Organization ID 407). Related tariffs include:\n    - PG (Parallel Generation)\n    - NM (Net Metering Rider)\n    - SCG (Small Customer Generator)\n    - PS (Powershare - actual DR program)\n    - PM (Power Manager - residential DR)",
