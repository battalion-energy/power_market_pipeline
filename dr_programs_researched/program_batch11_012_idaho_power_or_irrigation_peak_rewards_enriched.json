  "description": "The Irrigation Peak Rewards program offers financial incentives to agricultural irrigation customers for allowing Idaho Power to remotely turn off specific irrigation pumps during peak demand periods. The program runs seasonally from June 15 to September 15 with a minimum of three load control events per season. Participants can choose from three interruption options (Early, Standard, or Extended) with varying event windows and payment rates. This is an agriculture-specific load control program designed for irrigation pump equipment, NOT a general-purpose demand response program for battery energy storage systems.",
