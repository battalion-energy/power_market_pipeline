Currently only 79 MW registered as DRR-II in MISO (vs 521 MW DRR-I), indicating limited adoption. Behind-the-meter battery aggregation methodology under development. Energy payments subject to NBPT screening (only paid when LMP > $28-52/MWh). No capacity payments unless also registered as LMR. Best suited for batteries with advanced control systems, bidirectional inverters, and real-time communication infrastructure.
