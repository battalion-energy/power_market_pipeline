**Research Date:** October 11, 2025
**Research Duration:** 30 minutes
**Program Status:** Active (Currently Closed for Enrollment)

---

## Executive Summary

The Oncor Commercial Load Management (CLM) Program is a PUCT-mandated utility demand response program operating in the ERCOT market. It provides capacity payments to commercial/industrial customers who reduce electricity demand during summer peak hours (1-7 PM, Monday-Friday, June-September). The program is administered by Oncor Electric Delivery (a transmission/distribution utility) but delivered through retail electric providers and aggregators.

**Key Finding:** Program structure and requirements are well-documented, but **specific payment rates per kW are not publicly disclosed**. Historical data (2009-2010) showed rates of $564-566/kW, but current rates could not be confirmed.

## Critical Program Details

### Eligibility
- **Minimum Capacity:** 100 kW
- **Customer Classes:** Commercial and Industrial only
- **Exclusions:** Transmission-level for-profit customers, customers in other DR programs
- **Participation Pathway:** Through REP/aggregator OR direct self-enrollment

### Operating Parameters
- **Season:** June 1 - September 30
- **Call Window:** 1:00 PM - 7:00 PM Central Time
- **Operating Days:** Monday-Friday (excluding federal holidays)
- **Program Type:** Seasonal (not discrete events) - curtailment required throughout entire peak period

### Payment Structure
- **Type:** Capacity payment only (no performance/energy payment)
- **Calculation:** Based on verified kW reduction via interval meter data
- **Methodology:** Texas TRM (Technical Reference Manual)
- **Cap:** Limited to avoided cost to ensure cost-effectiveness
- **Payment Timing:** Post-season after verification
- **Current Rate:** NOT PUBLICLY DISCLOSED

### Oncor vs REP Relationship - CLARIFIED
**Oncor Role (Transmission/Distribution Utility):**
- Administers program and provides funding
- Sets program rules and requirements
- Performs measurement & verification using meter data
- Makes incentive payments to service providers
- Reports to PUCT on program performance

**REP/Aggregator Role (Service Providers):**
- Recruit and enroll customers
- Interface directly with participants
- Manage notifications and dispatch
- Receive payments from Oncor
- Compensate end customers per agreements

**Customer Role:**
- Participates through REP/aggregator OR self-enrolls
- Commits to load reduction during peak hours
- Receives compensation from service provider

This is **NOT a direct Oncor-to-customer program**. Oncor provides the funding and framework, but retail providers deliver the program to customers.

## ERCOT Market Integration

### Wholesale vs Retail Distinction
- **Program Level:** Retail/Distribution utility program
- **ERCOT Participation:** NO direct wholesale market participation
- **Coordination:** Yes - Oncor coordinates with ERCOT on load forecasting and reliability
- **Stacking Rules:** CANNOT participate in ERCOT wholesale DR programs with same capacity
- **Market Impact:** Reduces Oncor's peak demand obligation, improving ERCOT system adequacy

### Comparison to ERCOT Programs
| Program | Administrator | Level | Payment Type |
|---------|--------------|-------|--------------|
| Oncor CLM | Oncor (TDU) | Retail | Capacity |
| ERCOT ERS | ERCOT | Wholesale | Energy |
| ERCOT ECRS | ERCOT | Wholesale | Capacity |
| 4CP Programs | Various | Wholesale | Capacity |

**Key Insight:** This is a parallel retail-level program, not an alternative pathway to ERCOT wholesale markets.

## Data Sources & Reliability

### Primary Sources (Official)
✓ Oncor program website pages
✓ Texas PUC regulatory framework (16 TAC § 25.181)
✓ Texas Technical Reference Manual v12.0
✓ PUCT Interchange filings (partially accessible)

### Secondary Sources
✓ Energy Choice Matters (trade publication) - Winter Emergency program details
✓ EPA archived presentations - Historical rate data
✓ Industry aggregator sites - Budget information

### Data Gaps (NOT INVENTED)
❌ Current specific payment rate per kW
❌ Detailed notification procedures and timing
❌ Complete baseline calculation methodology
❌ Forward pricing curve
❌ Historical event data (N/A - program is seasonal, not event-based)

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Program Structure: Seasonal vs Event-Based
Unlike most DR programs, Oncor CLM requires curtailment throughout the **entire summer peak period** rather than discrete events. Participants must reduce load during 1-7 PM on all eligible weekdays, not just during called events. This makes the program predictable but demanding.

### 2. Payment Rate Mystery
Despite extensive research including:
- Official Oncor program pages
- PUCT Interchange filings
- Technical manuals and tariffs
- Historical program documents
- Trade publications

**Current payment rates are not publicly disclosed.** This appears intentional - rates are calculated using TRM methodology and capped at avoided cost, potentially varying by participant or contract. Historical rates from 15 years ago may not reflect current economics.

### 3. Related Programs
**Winter Emergency Program (2021-2022 Pilot):**
- 24/7 availability December-February
- ERCOT emergency response focus
- $2M budget for 50 MW
- Market-based payments (specific rates not disclosed)
- Developed post-Winter Storm Uri per Senate Bill 3

**Residential Load Management:**
- Smart thermostat-based
- Through REPs (Reliant, TXU, Octopus Energy, Rhythm)
- Same summer peak window

### 4. Regulatory Context
Program mandated under:
- Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) § 39.905
- PUCT Rule 16 TAC § 25.181 (Energy Efficiency Goals)
- Funded through EECRF (Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery Factor) rider
- TDUs may allocate up to 10% of EE budget to demand response

**2024-2025 Budgets:**
- Commercial EE programs: $8.5M (2024)
- Total Oncor EE programs: $21.3M (2024) → $151M (2025 projected)

### 5. Current Status
As of October 2025: **"The program is currently closed"** per Oncor website.

**Interpretation:** Enrollment likely closed for 2025 summer season (already past). Program expected to reopen Q1 2026 for summer 2026 participation. This is normal for annual/seasonal program cycles.

## Battery Optimization Considerations

### Favorable Aspects
✓ Predictable 6-hour window (1-7 PM) every weekday
✓ 100 kW minimum accessible to commercial batteries
✓ No discrete event limits - stable revenue opportunity
✓ Interval meter-based verification (objective measurement)

### Challenges
❌ 6-hour daily curtailment substantial for SOC management
❌ Summer-only (4 months) limits annual revenue
❌ Cannot cherry-pick high-price days - must perform all eligible days
❌ Cannot stack with ERCOT wholesale programs
❌ Payment timing post-season (cash flow consideration)
❌ Unknown payment rate creates revenue uncertainty

### Strategic Fit
**Best for:** Behind-the-meter commercial batteries with:
- 100+ kW capacity
- Daily cycling capability
- Predictable afternoon discharge schedule
- Limited access to wholesale markets
- Preference for stable seasonal payments vs volatile real-time

**Not ideal for:**
- Front-of-meter assets seeking wholesale market revenue
- Small systems <100 kW
- Assets needing payment rate certainty for financing
- Facilities unable to commit to 4-month seasonal curtailment

## Data Integrity Statement

**All information in this research is sourced from official documentation or reliable secondary sources. NO DATA WAS INVENTED.**

Where specific information (particularly payment rates) could not be found, this is explicitly documented as a data gap rather than estimated or fabricated. Historical rates from 2009-2010 are clearly labeled as such and not presented as current.

The complexity of the Oncor (TDU) → REP/Aggregator → Customer relationship was clarified through multiple sources and represents the actual program structure in Texas's deregulated retail electricity market.

**Verification Status:** VERIFIED WITH DOCUMENTED GAPS
**Data Quality Score:** 6.5/10

---

## Research Limitations

1. **Payment Rate Information:** Current specific rates not accessible through public sources. Program manuals and detailed rate schedules may exist but require direct contact with Oncor or service provider portal access.

2. **PDF Accessibility:** Some PUCT filings and program manuals (PDFs) were located but could not be fully extracted/read through automated tools. Manual download and review would provide additional detail.

3. **Forward Pricing:** No published forward curve or multi-year rate projections available.

4. **Participant Experience:** Research based on program documentation only. No participant interviews or operational experience data gathered.

5. **Baseline Methodology:** TRM methodologies referenced but specific calculation formulas not extracted. Would require detailed review of 500+ page Texas TRM document.

## Conclusion

The Oncor Commercial Load Management Program is a well-established, PUCT-mandated demand response program offering capacity payments for summer peak demand reduction in the ERCOT market. Program structure, eligibility, and operational requirements are clearly documented and verified through multiple official sources.

The critical limitation is **lack of publicly disclosed payment rates**, which creates revenue uncertainty for potential participants. Historical data suggests rates in the $500-600/kW range, but this cannot be confirmed for current or future program years.

For battery optimization, the program offers predictable summer revenue through consistent afternoon discharge (1-7 PM) but requires 4-month commitment, cannot be stacked with ERCOT wholesale programs, and has unknown compensation levels that may limit financial modeling accuracy.

**Program structure is appropriate for behind-the-meter commercial batteries seeking stable, predictable demand response revenue in Texas, subject to obtaining current rate information directly from Oncor or participating service providers.**
