    "explanation": "This is an energy efficiency program that provides custom incentives for innovative projects that reduce electricity consumption and peak demand. It is NOT a demand response program because it does not involve load curtailment, interruptible service, or dispatch signals. The demand reduction is achieved through permanent efficiency improvements, not temporary load reductions."
