## Executive Summary

Missouri participates in MISO's wholesale electricity markets through three primary demand response programs:

1. **Load Modifying Resources (LMR-DR)** - Capacity market program [ACTIVE - HIGH SUITABILITY FOR BATTERIES]
2. **Demand Response Resources (DRR)** - Energy market program [ACTIVE - LIMITED SUITABILITY FOR BATTERIES]
3. **Emergency Demand Response (EDR)** - Emergency reliability program [DISCONTINUED - NOT AVAILABLE]
4. **Ameren Missouri DR Program via Enel** - Utility aggregator program [ACTIVE - MODERATE SUITABILITY]

**CRITICAL UPDATE:** Missouri's third-party aggregator ban was lifted in October 2023, allowing C&I customers ≥100 kW to participate through aggregators in both MISO and SPP markets.

**GEOGRAPHIC CLARIFICATION:** Eastern Missouri (including St. Louis) is in MISO territory. Western Missouri (Kansas City area) spans both MISO and SPP territories. This research covers MISO territory only.

## Program 1: MISO Load Modifying Resources (LMR-DR) - ACTIVE

### Overview
- **Type:** Capacity market demand response
- **Status:** Active and well-established
- **Minimum Size:** 100 kW
- **Response Time:** 6 hours notification (current), transitioning to Type I (6-hour) and Type II (30-minute) in PY 2028-2029

### Payment Structure - Capacity Only

**Missouri Zone 5 Historical Clearing Prices ($/MW-day):**

| Planning Year | Summer | Fall | Winter | Spring |
|--------------|--------|------|--------|--------|
| 2022-2023 | $236.66 | $236.66 | $236.66 | $236.66 |
| 2023-2024 | $15.00 | $15.00 | $2.00 | $10.00 |
| 2024-2025 | $34.10 | **$719.81** | $0.75 | **$719.81** |
| 2025-2026 | $666.50 | Not available | Not available | Not available |

**Key Insight:** Missouri experienced extreme price volatility. Fall/Spring 2024-2025 hit Cost of New Entry ($719.81/MW-day) due to 872 MW capacity deficit from coal retirements and maintenance outages.

### Event Requirements
- **Frequency:** 5 events (Summer/Winter), 3 events (Fall/Spring) = 16 total/year
- **Duration:** Minimum 4 hours curtailment for 100% capacity credit
- **Testing:** Annual performance demonstration required

### Performance Measurement
- **Baseline:** Consumption baseline based on historical hourly demand profiles
- **Behind-the-meter generation:** Must use Tariff Attachment TT methodology
- **Verification:** 50-80% demonstration requires officer attestation

### Penalties
- **Current:** 3x LMP × MW shortfall
- **Proposed (PY 2028-2029):** VOLL × MW shortfall
- **VOLL:** Increased from $3,500/MWh to $10,000/MWh (effective Sept 30, 2025)

### Battery Suitability: ✅ **HIGH SUITABILITY**

**Strengths:**
- 100 kW minimum accessible for commercial-scale batteries
- 6-hour notification allows adequate planning
- 4-hour curtailment aligns with typical battery durations
- Limited events (16/year) minimizes cycling degradation
- High capacity payments in Missouri create strong revenue (Fall/Spring 2024-2025: $719.81/MW-day = $262k/MW-year)
- Third-party aggregator access since October 2023

**Limitations:**
- Extreme price volatility creates revenue uncertainty
- Cannot simultaneously participate as ESR in energy markets
- Behind-the-meter only (front-of-meter should use ESR model)

**Annual Revenue Example (1 MW battery):**
- Fall 2024 (61 days): $719.81 × 61 = $43,908
- Spring 2025 (92 days): $719.81 × 92 = $66,223
- Summer 2024 (122 days): $34.10 × 122 = $4,160
- Winter 2024-2025 (90 days): $0.75 × 90 = $68
- **Total PY 2024-2025: $114,359/MW**

## Program 2: MISO Demand Response Resources (DRR) - ACTIVE

### Overview
- **Type:** Energy market demand response (economic dispatch)
- **Status:** Active but low participation
- **Minimum Size:** 1 MW (1,000 kW)
- **Two Types:**
  - **DRR Type I:** Cannot follow dispatch (block commitments only) - e.g., utility interruptible programs
  - **DRR Type II:** Can follow dispatch instructions - e.g., behind-the-meter generation

### Payment Structure - Energy Only

**Compensation:** Locational Marginal Price (LMP) IF LMP > Net Benefit Price Threshold (NBPT)

**Net Benefit Price Threshold (NBPT):** $28-52/MWh (2024 range)

**Key Limitation:** Only paid when LMP exceeds NBPT, meaning many hours have zero revenue potential.

### Market Participation
- **Day-Ahead Market:** Must offer if cleared PRA for capacity
- **Real-Time Market:** Optional offers
- **Spinning Reserve:** Eligible (up to 40% of spin requirement)
- **Ramp Capability:** Only DRR Type II eligible

### Performance Issues
- **2023-24 Data:** Out of 213 spinning reserve deployments, 40%+ of DRR Type I failed to perform
- **Current Penalty:** Small penalties for non-performance
- **Proposed Reform:** Enhanced penalties and NBPT as minimum offer floor

### Current Registration
- **DRR Type I:** 521 MW registered (2023)
- **DRR Type II:** 79 MW registered (2023)

### Battery Suitability: ⚠️ **LIMITED SUITABILITY**

**Strengths:**
- 1 MW minimum accessible for utility-scale batteries
- Type II allows following dispatch (suits battery ops)
- 5-minute granularity matches battery response
- Can provide spinning reserve

**Significant Limitations:**
- Payment only when LMP > NBPT ($28-52/MWh) = many zero-revenue hours
- NBPT range low relative to battery degradation costs
- Cannot provide Energy and Contingency Reserve simultaneously (Type I)
- Low market participation (79 MW Type II) suggests poor economics
- 40% non-performance rate indicates regulatory scrutiny

**Recommendation:** Batteries should evaluate Electric Storage Resource (ESR) model instead for full energy market access without NBPT restrictions.

## Program 3: MISO Emergency Demand Response (EDR) - DISCONTINUED

### Status: ❌ **PROGRAM ELIMINATED**

**Critical Update:**
- MISO filed April 25, 2025 to eliminate dual registration of LMRs as EDRs
- Effective Planning Year 2026-2027
- Planning Year 2025-2026 is the FINAL YEAR
- Fast-tracked from original 2028-2029 timeline

### Why Eliminated?
1. **MISO has NEVER called upon EDRs in its entire history**
2. **$800 million in capacity payments since 2019 with ZERO deployment**
3. **FERC enforcement actions** against Voltus for exploiting dual registration
4. **883 MW registered as EDR (2023), only 552 MW also registered as LMR** = payment without performance obligations

### Historical Payment Structure
- **Capacity:** Same as LMR through dual registration
- **Energy:** $3,500/MWh (EDR Offer Cap = VOLL)
- **Penalty:** Minimal (primary reason for elimination)

### Battery Suitability: ❌ **NOT AVAILABLE**

**DO NOT PURSUE.** Program discontinued. Batteries should focus on active programs (LMR-DR, ESR, or utility programs).

### Best Program for Batteries: LMR-DR (Load Modifying Resources)

**Why:**
1. ✅ Accessible 100 kW minimum
2. ✅ High capacity payments ($719.81/MW-day Fall/Spring 2024-2025)
3. ✅ 6-hour notification allows planning
4. ✅ 4-hour events match battery duration
5. ✅ Limited cycling (16 events/year)
6. ✅ Third-party aggregator access

**Revenue Potential (1 MW behind-the-meter battery):**
- **Best Case (PY 2024-2025):** $114,359/MW-year
- **Conservative (PY 2023-2024):** $6,205/MW-year
- **High Volatility:** Plan for $50k-150k/MW-year range

### Alternative for Front-of-Meter Batteries: ESR Model

**Electric Storage Resource (ESR)** - Separate from DR programs
- Launched September 1, 2022
- Full energy and ancillary services market access
- No NBPT restrictions
- Can bid into day-ahead and real-time markets
- Suitable for utility-scale projects
- 15,000 MW in MISO interconnection queue

### Avoid: DRR and EDR Programs

- **DRR:** Low revenue potential (NBPT restrictions), poor economics
- **EDR:** Discontinued - not available

### Dual Participation Strategy (NOT ALLOWED)

**CRITICAL:** Battery cannot simultaneously participate as:
- LMR-DR (demand response) AND
- ESR (generation resource)

**Must choose ONE model.**
