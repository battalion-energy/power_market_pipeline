  "description": "The Capacity Bidding Program (CBP) is an aggregator-managed demand response program operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). The program is integrated with the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) wholesale market through Proxy Demand Resources (PDR). Aggregators receive monthly capacity payments for enrolled load reduction commitments and energy payments when events are called. PG&E triggers CBP events when it receives market awards from CAISO for PDR resources based on day-ahead market bids. The program operates during California's peak demand season from May through October.",

  "research_notes": "Conducted comprehensive web research on PG&E Capacity Bidding Program on 2025-10-11. Program is well-established (operating since 2006 CPUC authorization) and integrated with CAISO wholesale markets through Proxy Demand Resource mechanism. Key finding: the $6.00/kWh figure mentioned in initial research is actually a PENALTY rate for exceeding Firm Service Level during curtailment, NOT a performance payment rate. Program has good documentation for structure and eligibility but specific current payment rates are contained in Schedule E-CBP tariff PDF which could not be fully accessed. Historical rate data from CPUC E-4020 shows August 2006 capacity payments at $21.57/kW-month for certain products. Web search results indicated capacity payments ranging from $4-$12/kW-month varying by season and availability level, with current rates authorized through 2027. Program is explicitly battery-storage friendly with significant BESS deployment in PG&E territory (1,100 MW BTM storage, 35% of national total). Aggregator-managed structure means many operational details determined at aggregator level. Day-ahead notification at 5 PM for next-day events. Program compatible with stacking (E-OBMC, ELRP-B2, SGIP). For complete current financial details, direct access to Schedule E-CBP tariff required. Overall data quality good for program structure and parameters but limited for specific current financial rates.",

Primary limitation is inability to access current Schedule E-CBP tariff rates (PDF encoding issues). Successfully clarified $6/kWh as penalty not payment. Good understanding of program structure, eligibility, and integration mechanisms.",
    "recommended_next_steps": [
      "Access Schedule E-CBP tariff document directly from PG&E (contact customer service or download via alternative method) for current capacity payment rates",
      "Contact PG&E demand response team for detailed program parameters and current enrollment information",
      "Research specific aggregators operating in PG&E territory (e.g., Enel, OhmConnect, others) for customer-facing program details",
      "Access CAISO DRRS documentation for PDR registration and bidding procedures",
      "Request historical event data from PG&E or aggregators",
      "Investigate DRAM program as comparable alternative with similar CAISO integration",
      "Review SGIP requirements for DR program participation to understand battery storage integration",
      "Contact existing program participants for real-world experience data"
    ],
    "notes": "Program is well-suited for battery optimization given: (1) Day-ahead notification allows for planning, (2) Defined call windows (4-10 PM peak hours), (3) CAISO market integration provides price signals, (4) Battery storage explicitly eligible, (5) Stacking allowed with other programs, (6) Aggregator structure provides operational flexibility. Key considerations: (1) Performance threshold is 95% minimum for full payment with penalties for shortfalls, (2) Events limited to peak hours but can occur frequently during summer, (3) Payment economics depend on specific capacity rates which require tariff access, (4) CAISO PDR requires 100 kW minimum which may limit small systems. Program appears compatible with behind-the-meter battery revenue stacking strategies. May-October season leaves Nov-April available for other revenue opportunities."
