The program balances reliability needs with customer convenience through flexible notification options and opt-out provisions. Environmental restrictions are notably stricter than many other programs. The separate DSGS program for battery aggregators indicates LADWP's interest in DER aggregation but suggests the main DR program is primarily designed for direct customer load reduction rather than aggregator participation."
