Battery operators must choose: (1) NWS upfront capital incentive + restricted operation, OR (2) DLRP ongoing demand response revenue + operational flexibility. This is a strategic decision during project planning phase and cannot be changed once NWS Program Agreement is signed."

    "notes": "DLRP is fourth Con Edison demand response program researched (after CSRP in Batch 8, Term/Auto-DLM in Batch 10, LMIP reference). Known as excellent distribution-constrained area program with higher capacity payments than CSRP. Key differentiators: (1) Faster response requirements (0-2 hours vs CSRP's 21 hours), (2) Higher capacity payments ($18-25/kW-month vs CSRP's $6-18/kW-month), (3) Distribution network-specific operation (82 networks vs borough-level tiers), (4) Can stack with CSRP for maximum revenue. Battery suitability excellent for fast-responding systems in Tier 2 networks, with critical restriction on NWS program conflicts. Program event frequency increasing over time (8 days 2022 → 14 days 2024) indicating growing importance to grid reliability."
