This program is designed to maintain grid stability during Stage 3 emergencies when CAISO declares rotating outages. Participants must develop and submit an OBMC Plan acceptable to SCE prior to participation. Unlike other demand response programs, OBMC provides no monetary incentive - the sole benefit is exemption from rotating outages, with significant penalties ($6.00/kWh) for non-performance.",
