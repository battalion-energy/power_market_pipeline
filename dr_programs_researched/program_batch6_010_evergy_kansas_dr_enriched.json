    "program_assessment": "Evergy's Business Demand Response program is a well-structured voluntary utility-level DR program with strong regulatory support through KEEIA approval. The program offers flexibility (no penalties, opt-out allowed, customized curtailment plans) attractive to business customers. However, lack of publicly available payment rates makes financial analysis impossible without direct contact with Evergy.",
    "kansas_vs_wholesale_market": "Important distinction: This is a utility-level program, not an SPP wholesale market DR program. The May 2024 KCC settlement gives Evergy control over customer participation in SPP markets, which could limit opportunities for aggregators or direct wholesale participation. Behind-the-meter batteries would need to navigate this utility gatekeeper arrangement.",
    "data_transparency_concern": "Evergy provides excellent programmatic transparency (how program works, event parameters, contact info) but financial transparency is very limited. No publicly available payment rates, budgets, or incentive levels makes it difficult to assess economic opportunity without direct engagement.",
    "battery_storage_opportunity": "Program design suggests strong fit for battery energy storage: voluntary participation, self-generation encouraged, no utility equipment control, afternoon peak timing aligns with solar+storage economics, and Kansas summer heat creates reliable event frequency. However, specific battery participation rules require verification.",
    "2024_program_evolution": "The 2024 changes (tiered event participation, bonus for extended duration) show program maturation and flexibility. Participants can balance commitment level with operational constraints. Extended duration option (7-10 hours) particularly interesting for battery storage given typical 4-hour duration batteries.",
    "spp_context": "SPP's declining reserve margins (24% to 5% by 2029) and lack of capacity market creates strong value proposition for utility-level DR. Evergy's DR program will likely become increasingly important to regional reliability, potentially leading to improved incentives over time.",
    "recommended_next_steps": "For battery storage project evaluation: 1) Contact Evergy BDR team with battery-specific questions, 2) Request facility assessment for target site, 3) Clarify baseline methodology and battery charging treatment, 4) Understand wholesale market participation restrictions under 23-EKCE settlement, 5) Compare utility DR incentives vs. SPP wholesale market opportunities if accessible."
  },
  "spp_wholesale_market_note": {
    "important_distinction": "Kansas is in SPP (Southwest Power Pool) RTO territory. SPP operates wholesale energy and reserve markets but NO CAPACITY MARKET. Evergy's Business Demand Response is a UTILITY-LEVEL PROGRAM, not an SPP wholesale market program.",
    "wholesale_dr_in_spp": "SPP does have demand response participation in its wholesale markets, but the May 2024 KCC settlement (docket 23-EKCE) gives Evergy control over whether its customers can participate in these wholesale markets. This 'gatekeeper' arrangement was opposed by Vote Solar and Sierra Club as potentially limiting customer choice.",
    "dual_participation_question": "UNCLEAR whether a customer can participate in both Evergy's utility DR program AND SPP wholesale markets simultaneously, or if Evergy requires exclusive participation in utility program. This would need clarification from Evergy and is particularly important for battery storage developers evaluating revenue stacking opportunities.",
    "aggregator_implications": "The settlement allowing Evergy to control wholesale market access may limit opportunities for third-party aggregators (like Voltus, which participated in settlement) to enroll Evergy customers directly into SPP markets without utility approval."
