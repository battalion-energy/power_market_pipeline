    "reason": "EnergyWise Business is designed as an HVAC-focused demand response program for small to mid-size commercial customers. Program structure centers on smart thermostat installation (Summer) or manual/signaled load curtailment (Winter) for air conditioning and heating equipment. While Winter Option theoretically allows equipment connection to Duke's control system, there is no documentation, precedent, or technical guidance for battery participation. The utility-controlled or signal-based model conflicts with typical battery optimization strategies requiring precise SOC management, charging schedules, and arbitrage opportunities. Additionally, the specific incentive rate for South Carolina is not publicly documented, making revenue modeling impossible.",
