No explicit battery storage language found, but TECO is actively investing in battery storage through utility-owned microgrid pilot and has commercial DR partnership with Enel. Traditional program appears designed for direct load control (AC, specialized equipment) rather than dispatchable storage assets. Baseline methodology not fully documented in public materials - requires direct contact with utility.",
