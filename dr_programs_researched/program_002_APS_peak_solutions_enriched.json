  "description": "APS Peak Solutions is a commercial and industrial demand response program operated by Arizona Public Service (APS) in partnership with CPower Energy. Launched in 2010, the program provides financial rewards to business customers who voluntarily reduce electricity consumption during peak demand periods, typically during summer months (June-September). The program has notably low barriers to entry with a minimum 10 kW commitment and no penalties for non-performance, making it accessible to both small and large commercial customers. A program redesign is planned for Fall 2025.",

Program is well-documented for high-level features (eligibility, launch date, partnership structure, no penalties) but specific operational and financial details are not publicly available. The 10 kW minimum and no-penalty structure are consistently highlighted across sources as differentiators. Payment structure appears to be customized per participant rather than published fixed rates. Found good earnings examples (2023 collective $870K, Royal Paper $85K) but not underlying rate structures. Program appears to operate primarily June-September during Arizona's extreme summer heat, with peak hours 4-7 PM. Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time. Program is part of larger APS Virtual Power Plant initiative approaching 200 MW total capacity. Fall 2025 redesign mentioned but details not available. For complete operational parameters and financial details, direct enrollment or contact with CPower (844-276-9371) would be required. Overall data quality is moderate - good program description and eligibility details, but missing critical operational and payment specifics that would be needed for optimization modeling.",

Payment structures appear customized based on facility assessment rather than published fixed rates. Good candidate for battery or flexible load optimization given summer-focused operation, predictable peak hours (4-7 PM), and day-ahead notification option. However, lack of published event limits (max events/hours per year) makes revenue forecasting challenging without direct program enrollment. Program redesign planned for Fall 2025 may bring changes to structure and potentially better public documentation."
