  "description": "Tucson Electric Power's Smart Demand Response (SmartDR) Program offers large commercial, industrial, and institutional customers the opportunity to reduce energy costs by curtailing energy use during high demand periods or system constraints. Customers develop customized Energy Reduction Plans in collaboration with TEP's Commercial Energy Solutions team and receive quarterly bill credits based on their load reduction performance during events. The program is designed for operational flexibility with no penalties for opting out of individual events, though quarterly credits are reduced for non-participation. Participants typically curtail non-essential systems such as motors, refrigeration, lighting, and HVAC during events lasting several hours. No special equipment is required beyond what customers already operate.",

  "research_notes": "Conducted comprehensive web research on TEP SmartDR program on October 11, 2025. Research included: TEP program webpages, related program comparisons (Interruptible Service, Energy Storage Rewards), Piclo marketplace listing, TEP 2023 IRP, news articles on 2024 peak demand records, Arizona Corporation Commission context, and climate/temperature data. Program is minimally documented in public sources with only high-level marketing information available. Key program parameters essential for economic analysis are not publicly disclosed: payment rates, capacity requirements, event frequency/duration, notification timing, baseline methodology, and performance requirements. Battery energy storage eligibility is completely unclear for commercial participants despite TEP's demonstrated interest in residential battery DR through separate Energy Storage Rewards program. SmartDR appears positioned as flexible, low-barrier alternative to more stringent Interruptible Service program. Key differentiators: no penalties for opt-outs, adjustable Energy Reduction Plans, voluntary event participation, no special equipment requirements, quarterly bill credit payment structure. Program operates in context of Arizona's extreme summer heat and growing peak demand challenges, demonstrated by August 2024 peak demand records during 111-112°F temperatures. TEP's broader strategy includes major battery storage expansion (51 MW currently to 1,361 MW by 2038) and demand response programs to manage load growth and integrate renewables. Arizona's non-ISO utility structure limits market transparency compared to competitive wholesale markets. Overall data quality is poor (4/10) due to lack of public documentation - suitable for general awareness of program existence and basic structure, but insufficient for detailed economic modeling, optimization analysis, or investment decisions without direct engagement with TEP. For battery energy storage specifically, eligibility cannot be confirmed and value proposition cannot be quantified from available information. Critical next step is direct contact with TEP Commercial Energy Solutions (520-745-3425, smartdr@tep.com) to obtain: (1) confirmation of battery eligibility, (2) specific payment rates and calculation methodology, (3) historical event data, (4) Energy Reduction Plan requirements, (5) M&V procedures, (6) current program status resolution.",
