  "description": "Saver's Switch is a direct load control program that allows Xcel Energy (Northern States Power Company) to remotely cycle residential and commercial air conditioning units and electric water heaters during high demand periods. The program uses small remote-controlled switches installed adjacent to customer equipment. Current operation involves cycling equipment off for 15 minutes, then on for 15 minutes during peak demand days. The program is designed to reduce peak demand by up to 60% during load management periods, with the utility reserving the right to cycle equipment on a schedule to achieve up to 80% reduction for additional load relief. The program has operated for several decades in South Dakota. In April 2024, the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission denied Xcel's request to extend cycling parameters to 18 minutes off/12 minutes on for up to 300 hours per year.",

The program involves physical installation of remote-controlled switches on air conditioning compressors and water heaters to cycle them on/off during peak demand periods. Battery energy storage systems are not eligible equipment types for this program. Xcel Energy operates separate battery storage programs (such as Battery Connect and distributed capacity procurement initiatives) that would be more appropriate for commercial BESS participation.",

    "notes": "Data quality score of 4/10 reflects: (1) confirmed program existence and active status, (2) verified regulatory filings and PUC actions, (3) confirmed payment structure for MN/WI territories but not independently verified for SD, (4) limited specific historical event data (only aggregate 5-year summary available), (5) no access to actual tariff sheets with detailed terms, (6) clear confirmation that program is not applicable to battery storage. The program is well-documented as an AC/water heater direct load control program, but detailed operational data and SD-specific rates could not be independently confirmed. This program should be classified as N/A for battery suitability rather than POOR because it fundamentally serves a different purpose (HVAC load control) and is not designed or intended for battery storage applications."
