  "description": "Emergency Demand Response (EDR) was MISO's emergency reliability program that allowed commitment and dispatch of load reductions, behind-the-meter generation, and other demand resources during NERC Energy Emergency Alerts (EEA2, EEA3) or other emergency events. EDR resources received capacity payments through dual registration with LMRs. CRITICAL UPDATE: MISO is eliminating the dual registration of LMRs as EDRs effective Planning Year 2026-2027 (filed with FERC April 25, 2025). The 2025/26 Planning Resource Auction will be the LAST year dual registration is permitted. MISO has NEVER called upon EDRs in its history despite $800 million in capacity payments since 2019.",

PROGRAM STATUS: DISCONTINUED - The dual registration of LMRs as EDRs is being eliminated effective Planning Year 2026-2027. The 2025-2026 planning year will be the FINAL year this program accepts participants. HISTORICAL CONTEXT: This program's elimination was driven by: (1) MISO has NEVER called upon EDRs in its entire history, (2) $800 million in capacity payments since 2019 with zero actual deployment, (3) FERC enforcement actions for market manipulation, (4) 40% of registered EDRs were not also registered as LMRs, indicating payment without performance obligations. RECOMMENDATION FOR BATTERIES: DO NOT pursue EDR registration. Instead, evaluate: (1) LMR-DR program for capacity market participation (active and suitable), (2) Electric Storage Resource (ESR) model for energy market participation (active and well-suited), (3) DRR Type II for energy market demand response (active but limited suitability). The elimination of EDR removes a potential revenue stream but also eliminates a program that had minimal deployment likelihood and increasing regulatory scrutiny."
