  "research_notes": "MISO demand response programs offer excellent opportunities for BESS in South Dakota. The 2025/26 capacity auction showed dramatic price increases (22x increase from prior year) driven by capacity shortages in the North/Central region. Key findings: (1) South Dakota is part of MISO North/Central pricing region, not a separate 'Zone 6'; (2) Capacity prices are exceptional at $666.50/MW-day for summer 2025 and $217/MW-day annualized; (3) BESS can participate either as behind-the-meter demand response (simpler) or as Electric Storage Resource (full market access); (4) 0.1 MW minimum allows smaller BESS projects; (5) Fast response time (<2hrs) and >4hr duration earns 100% capacity credit - ideal for BESS; (6) DRR Type II provides access to lucrative ancillary services markets; (7) EDR program eliminated for 2025/26 but LMR and DRR programs remain strong; (8) Market participant certification required (60-90 day timeline); (9) EPNode locational registration now required. The combination of high capacity prices, low barriers to entry, and multiple revenue streams makes this an excellent opportunity for BESS projects in South Dakota.",
  "research_date": "2025-10-12",
  "research_quality_score": 8,
  "quality_score_explanation": "High quality research with verified capacity clearing prices from official MISO auction results, detailed program parameters from MISO Business Practices Manual and workshop presentations, and recent regulatory filings. Score limited to 8 (not 10) because: (1) Could not access some PDFs directly to verify exact details; (2) Some operational parameters like annual event limits not publicly available; (3) Baseline methodology details referenced but not fully extracted from BPM-026; (4) South Dakota-specific transmission or zonal constraints not documented. All capacity prices and program structures are from official MISO sources and industry analysis."
