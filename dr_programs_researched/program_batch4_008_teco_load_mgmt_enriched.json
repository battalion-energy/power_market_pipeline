  "description": "Tampa Electric's Load Management Program allows commercial and industrial customers to earn monthly bill credits by permitting Tampa Electric to temporarily control air conditioning or specialized refrigeration equipment during critical energy-use periods. The program offers two payment options: Cyclic (seasonal, April-October) and Continuous (year-round), with equipment installed at no cost to participants. Control periods vary by season, with summer controls typically occurring 2-10 PM and winter controls during morning (6-11 AM) and evening (6-10 PM) periods. The program is currently paused for upgrades. This is distinct from Tampa Electric's Conservation Value Program, which provides capital rebates for energy efficiency projects.",
