TVA operates through partnership with Enel North America who manages all program operations. Program appears to use customized payment structures based on individual participant capacity and performance capabilities rather than published fixed rates. Found excellent case study (Metro Nashville Public Schools) providing real earnings data over 10-year period. Winter Storm Elliott (Dec 2022) and Summer 2024 heat waves provide context for actual event calls. TVA is investing $1.5B through 2027 in DR programs, indicating strong commitment. For complete financial details, direct contact with Enel or TVA would be required. The 32-hour annual limit was verified from multiple sources. PowerFlex program exists as separate offering for larger customers (>1MW) with different structure. Overall data quality is good for operational parameters but limited for financial specifics.",
