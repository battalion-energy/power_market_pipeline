  "description": "LADWP's Demand Response is a voluntary, incentive-based energy management program for commercial and industrial businesses that provides monetary incentives for reducing electrical usage during peak load periods on hot summer days. The program helps reduce utility bills during times of peak power demand while ensuring continued reliability of power for Los Angeles. Participants control their own curtailment procedures and receive both capacity payments (monthly) and performance payments (per event). Since 2015, the program has saved 4,836 MWh and paid approximately $8 million in incentives to participants including commercial customers like Ace Hotel, Anheuser-Busch, and Paramount Pictures.",
