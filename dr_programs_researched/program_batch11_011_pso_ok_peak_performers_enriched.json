The program rewards commercial, industrial, and institutional customers who voluntarily reduce electricity consumption during periods of peak demand. Participants receive payments based on the average kilowatt savings achieved during peak events, which are called during summer months (June-October) when electricity demand is highest. The program operates from 2-7 PM on non-holiday weekdays and offers bonus payments for participating in all events.",

While the $32/kW payment rate appears attractive, the limited event frequency (max 16 events/year, 80 hours total) and uncertainty around payment structure create substantial revenue risk. The program documentation does not explicitly mention battery storage as an eligible resource type, though load reduction is clearly eligible. The 5-hour event window (2-7 PM) is manageable for a 1 MW/1 MWh battery, but daily cycling would deplete the battery. Most critically, the payment structure is ambiguous - it's unclear if $32/kW is paid per event, per season, or per year. If per event, revenue could be attractive ($512/event * 16 = $8,192/year for 1 MW participating in all events). However, if it's a seasonal or annual capacity payment, revenue would be limited. The voluntary nature with no penalties is positive, but the lack of clear baseline methodology and M&V procedures creates uncertainty. Overall, this program could serve as a supplemental revenue stream but should not be a primary revenue source for battery optimization.",

A 1 MW battery could reasonably expect $20-40K annually if $32/kW is a seasonal capacity payment.

  "research_notes": "Conducted comprehensive web research on PSO Peak Performers Program on 2025-10-12. Program is moderately well-documented for general structure (eligibility, event windows, voluntary participation) but critical financial details are ambiguous. The $32/kW payment rate is stated clearly but whether this is per-event, per-season, or annual total is not specified in public documentation. Historical payment data (2020: $2.1M to 243 businesses, ~$8,642 average) suggests moderate per-business payments, but size distribution unknown. Battery storage is not explicitly mentioned as eligible resource, though load reduction clearly is. Program has operated since 2013 with consistent structure. Oklahoma Corporation Commission annual reports (2022, 2023, 2024) exist but PDF content could not be parsed - these reports likely contain detailed event history and performance data that would substantially improve revenue estimates. Major limitation is lack of historical event data - while program allows up to 16 events, actual call frequency unknown. Program appears designed primarily for load curtailment (HVAC, lighting, equipment) rather than battery dispatch. Given ambiguities, recommend direct contact with PSO for clarification before making investment decisions. Overall assessment: LIMITED suitability for battery energy storage due to payment structure uncertainty, limited event frequency, and lack of explicit battery eligibility confirmation. Could serve as supplemental revenue but not primary revenue source.",

      "Obtain baseline calculation methodology and M&V procedures",
      "Request notification timing (hours/days in advance) and methods - inquire about API availability",

    ],
    "notes": "Program has been operating successfully for 10+ years with 250+ businesses enrolled, indicating stable and reliable operation. However, lack of transparency in payment calculation and battery eligibility creates significant uncertainty for battery energy storage projects. Oklahoma/SPP market fundamentals are less favorable than ERCOT or CAISO for standalone battery projects - lower price volatility, fewer extreme peak events, and more traditional generation mix. Battery projects in this market likely require revenue stacking across multiple value streams (DR + reserves + arbitrage + demand charges) plus favorable development costs or incentives to achieve acceptable returns. Recommend thorough due diligence and direct utility engagement before pursuing battery projects in PSO territory specifically for Peak Performers program participation."
