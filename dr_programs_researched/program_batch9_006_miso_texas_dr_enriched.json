  "research_notes": "CONFIRMED: MISO does operate in Texas, but only in Southeast Texas through Entergy Texas (27 counties, 524k customers). Entergy Texas joined MISO South region in 2013. This represents a small footprint compared to ERCOT which covers most of Texas. The original database entry is CORRECT, not an error.\n\nMajor findings:\n1. MISO operates in Southeast Texas (Beaumont-Port Arthur, Conroe-The Woodlands areas) serving 524,000 customers across 27 counties through Entergy Texas\n2. 2025 is a transformational year for MISO DR programs - EDR eliminated, LMR reforms creating Type I (6hr) and Type II (30min) categories\n3. Record-high capacity prices in 2025 auction ($666.50/MW-day summer, 2100% increase from 2024) creating strong economics for battery participation\n4. Battery storage explicitly eligible as Electric Storage Resources (ESRs) and can participate as LMRs\n5. Storage participation grew 10x from 2024 to 2025 auctions (50 MW to 0.5 GW)\n6. Fast-response batteries ideal for Type II LMR (30min notification) earning 100% capacity credit vs 50-70% for slower resources\n7. Program stability concerns: Testing methodology changed twice in late 2024, new aggregator requirements, increased penalties ($10k/MWh VOLL)\n8. Emergency callouts historically rare (MISO never called EDRs), so minimal impact on energy arbitrage operations\n9. Strong battery suitability due to: explicit eligibility, fast response advantage, record capacity prices, 95% initial capacity credit, revenue stacking opportunities\n10. Key constraint: Only applies to Southeast Texas Entergy service territory, not ERCOT-served areas",

  "research_quality_score": 9,
  "quality_score_rationale": "Comprehensive research with multiple authoritative sources including MISO official documents, recent auction results, and reform announcements. Confirmed geographic presence in Texas through Entergy service territory. Detailed program structure, payment rates, and battery eligibility documented. Only limitation is lack of specific CBL calculation formulas (would require BPM-026 full document access). Strong confidence in findings."
