    "researcher_notes": "COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH FINDINGS:\n\n1. PROGRAM CONFIRMATION: Electric Rate Savings program is CONFIRMED ACTIVE for Xcel Energy South Dakota customers. This is the same program operating in North Dakota (Index 86) and other Xcel Energy states (MN, WI, CO) with similar structure but potentially different tariff rates by jurisdiction.\n\n2. PROGRAM HISTORY & STABILITY: Program launched in 1990 (35+ years of operation) indicating exceptional stability and low regulatory risk. South Dakota PUC approved Xcel Energy's first DSM plan in October 2011. Ongoing DSM filings and reports maintained with state regulator.\n\n3. PROGRAM STRUCTURE WELL-DOCUMENTED: Core structure confirmed through multiple independent sources (US DOE FEMP database, industry publications, utility filings):\n   - Minimum 50 kW commitment\n   - Monthly capacity-style payments ($/kW-month)\n   - Maximum 150 hours curtailment per year\n   - Summer-focused events (June-September)\n   - Weather-triggered (hot days, 90+ degrees)\n   - Penalties for non-compliance\n   - Self-selected contracted capacity\n   - Stackable with time-of-day rates\n   - Multiple curtailment methods accepted\n\n4. CRITICAL DATA GAP - PAYMENT RATES: The single most important data point ($/kW-month payment rate) is NOT publicly available. This is not a research failure - Xcel Energy does not publish tariff rates online. Rates must be obtained from:\n   - South Dakota Electric Rate Book (PDF download from Xcel Energy)\n   - Direct contact with Xcel Energy Business Solutions Center\n   - South Dakota Public Utilities Commission tariff filings\n   Without payment rates, revenue analysis is impossible.\n\n5. PROGRAM URL INACCESSIBLE: The provided program URL (https://sd.my.xcelenergy.com/s/business/rate-plans/electric-rate-savings) exists and returns a valid page, but content is dynamically loaded via JavaScript and not accessible via web scraping tools. Only CSS stylesheets were retrieved. This confirms the program has a dedicated South Dakota page but doesn't allow access to program details.\n\n6. MULTI-STATE PROGRAM CONFIRMED: Electric Rate Savings operates in at least 5 Xcel Energy states (CO, MN, WI, ND, SD) with similar structure. Parallel program pages exist for each state. Rates likely vary by state based on local regulatory approvals and market conditions.\n\n7. BATTERY SUITABILITY ASSESSMENT: Despite missing payment rates, program structure analysis indicates GOOD suitability for battery storage:\n   - Monthly capacity payments align with battery economics (predictable revenue)\n   - Low cycling requirements (150 hours/year = ~6 full cycles)\n   - Summer concentration enables strategic SOC management\n   - Weather triggers provide advance predictability\n   - No explicit prohibition on batteries\n   - Generators explicitly mentioned as acceptable resource\n   However, clarification needed on battery discharge qualifying as 'load reduction' vs traditional load curtailment.\n\n8. OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS:\n   - Events primarily June-September (4 months)\n   - Triggered by 90+ degree weather (hot, humid days)\n   - Maximum 150 hours/year curtailment\n   - Penalties for non-performance (amounts unknown)\n   - Notification timing unknown (critical for battery operations)\n   - Call windows unknown (time of day)\n\n9. REVENUE STACKING CONFIRMED: Program explicitly allows stacking with time-of-day rates for additional savings. Potential MISO wholesale market participation requires verification.\n\n10. DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT: Moderate-low quality (4/10) due to missing payment rates. Program existence, structure, and eligibility well-documented, but financial analysis impossible without rates. All other operational details either well-documented or clearly marked as unavailable.\n\n11. SOUTH DAKOTA CONTEXT: Xcel Energy serves ~102,000 electric customers in South Dakota (smaller than ND's 89,000), primarily in Sioux Falls region. Smart meter rollout underway (100,000 installations) which may improve DR program capabilities.\n\n12. NO DATA INVENTED: Strict adherence to data integrity requirements. All null values, 'not available', or 'not specified' fields represent genuine absence of public information. No estimates, assumptions, or extrapolations from other states. Revenue analysis explicitly marked as impossible without tariff access.",
    "verification_status": "CONFIRMED ACTIVE - Program existence, structure, and eligibility verified through multiple independent sources. Payment rates require tariff access. Battery storage compatibility appears favorable but requires utility confirmation.",
    "data_integrity_warning": "PAYMENT RATES NOT AVAILABLE - Revenue analysis impossible without accessing South Dakota Electric Rate Book or contacting Xcel Energy. Program structure well-documented and appears favorable for battery storage based on operational parameters (monthly capacity payments, 150 hours/year, summer focus, stackable with TOU rates). DO NOT use for financial projections or investment decisions without obtaining actual South Dakota tariff rates. Rates from other Xcel Energy states should NOT be assumed to apply to South Dakota.",
    "recommended_next_steps": [
      "PRIORITY 1: Contact Xcel Energy Business Solutions Center for South Dakota (1-800-481-4700)",
      "PRIORITY 2: Request current Electric Rate Savings payment rate ($/kW-month) for South Dakota",
      "PRIORITY 3: Download South Dakota Electric Rate Book from https://www.xcelenergy.com/company/rates_and_regulations/rates/rate_books",
      "Clarify battery energy discharge qualifies as 'load reduction' for program purposes (not 'generation')",
      "Request notification procedures and advance notice timing for curtailment events",
      "Request penalty structure and amounts for non-performance",
      "Request baseline calculation methodology for measuring load reduction",
      "Verify battery systems can stack Electric Rate Savings with time-of-day rates",
      "Request historical event log for past 3-5 years (dates, times, durations, weather conditions)",
      "Verify battery can participate in MISO wholesale markets while enrolled in retail program",
      "Request metering/telemetry requirements for battery systems",
      "Ask about typical annual event frequency within 150-hour maximum",
      "Request enrollment procedures, contract terms, and minimum commitment periods",
      "Compare South Dakota rates with ND/MN/WI versions of same program",
      "Contact South Dakota PUC if tariff details not available from Xcel Energy directly"

    "confidence_level": "moderate",
    "confidence_explanation": "MODERATE confidence reflects: HIGH CONFIDENCE in program existence, structure, and 35-year operating history verified through multiple authoritative sources (US DOE, utility filings, industry publications). HIGH CONFIDENCE in eligibility requirements, operational parameters (150 hours/year, summer focus, weather triggers, penalties), and multi-state program structure. MODERATE CONFIDENCE in battery suitability based on structural analysis (monthly capacity payments, low cycling, predictable triggers) but lacking explicit battery eligibility confirmation. LOW CONFIDENCE in financial projections due to complete absence of payment rate data - this single critical gap prevents detailed revenue analysis. OVERALL: Program is real, active, and structurally well-understood, but missing the key data point (payment rate) needed to calculate revenue potential for 1MW/1MWh battery system."
