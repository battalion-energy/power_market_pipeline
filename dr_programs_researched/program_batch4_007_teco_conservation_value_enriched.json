  "description": "Tampa Electric's Conservation Value rebate program provides capital incentives to commercial and industrial customers for investments in peak-demand shifting or reduction technologies. The program offers up to $92 per kilowatt (kW) of verified demand reduction measured during specific utility peak periods: 5 PM in August and 7 AM in January (Monday-Friday only). This is NOT a demand response program with event-based dispatch - it is an energy efficiency capital rebate program that rewards permanent installations that reduce peak demand concurrently with utility system peaks. Projects must have a minimum 2-year payback period to qualify. For savings exceeding 50 kW, rebates are paid in two installments: 50% after 90 days of verified operation and 50% after 12 months of successful operation.",
