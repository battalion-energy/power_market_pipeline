  "description": "Entergy Arkansas' Smart Direct Load Control Pilot Program is a demand response program that provides residential and small business customers with free advanced smart thermostats and professional installation. During peak demand periods between June and September, Entergy can remotely adjust enrolled thermostats by 2-4 degrees to reduce grid stress. Customers receive enrollment incentives and annual participation incentives based on their opt-out frequency. The program launched as a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) pilot in April 2017 and has expanded to include free thermostat installation. It complements Entergy's older Summer Advantage program which uses direct cycling units (DCUs) on AC compressors.",

Program evolved from 2017 BYOD pilot with Comverge to current dual-path offering (free installation or BYOD) managed by ICF under 2024-2027 contract. The program complements older Summer Advantage DCU program, with customers unable to participate in both simultaneously. Payment structure is straightforward with fixed enrollment and annual incentives tied to opt-out frequency rather than complex capacity/performance payments. MISO membership confirmed (since 2013). Key limitation: attempted to access Smart_DLC_Guidebook.pdf which likely contains detailed program rules but DNS resolution failed for cdn.entergy-arkansas.com. Arkansas PSC energy efficiency annual reports page was JavaScript-heavy and did not reveal report links.

Program is part of broader ICF-managed EE/DR portfolio through 2027. MISO operates as RTO for Entergy Arkansas (since 2013), so program operates within MISO South footprint."
