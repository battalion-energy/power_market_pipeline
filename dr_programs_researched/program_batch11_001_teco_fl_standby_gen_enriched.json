  "description": "Tampa Electric's Standby Generator Program is a utility-administered demand response program for commercial and industrial customers with on-site standby backup generators. Participants earn monthly bill credits by transferring their electrical load to backup generators during peak demand periods. The program operates year-round with distinct summer and winter call windows. CRITICAL NOTE: This program is explicitly designed for STANDBY GENERATORS (diesel, natural gas, or other fossil fuel generators) and is NOT eligible for battery energy storage systems. All available documentation emphasizes 'standby generator' and 'backup generator' terminology, with program administration by Enel focusing on generator-based load transfer. No official source confirms battery storage eligibility. This is a GENERATOR-ONLY program.",

This program is explicitly designed for standby generators (fossil fuel backup generators), NOT battery energy storage systems. CRITICAL ISSUES FOR BATTERY PARTICIPATION: (1) All official documentation consistently uses 'standby generator' and 'backup generator' terminology with NO mention of battery storage eligibility across multiple sources, (2) Program administration by Enel emphasizes generator-based load transfer during dispatch events, (3) EPA classification as 'non-emergency generator program' specifically refers to fossil fuel generators running for demand response (not batteries), (4) Program has 20+ year history focused on fossil fuel generator resources, (5) No evidence that battery discharge qualifies as 'load transfer' under program rules, (6) Tariff sections 7.550 and 3.200-3.202 define program eligibility but are not accessible in full detail. CONCLUSION: DO NOT include this program in battery optimization models. This is a GENERATOR-ONLY program. Battery systems are NOT eligible. Payment rate of $6.15/kW is modest compared to battery-compatible C&I demand response programs ($20-50+/kW more common).

COMPARISON TO TECO LOAD MANAGEMENT PROGRAM: This is distinct from Tampa Electric's Load Management Program (researched in Batch 9) which focuses on cycling/curtailment of customer equipment like air handlers and water heaters. The Standby Generator Program requires participants to own and operate backup generators for load transfer.
