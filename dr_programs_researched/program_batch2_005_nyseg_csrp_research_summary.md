## Executive Summary

NYSEG's Commercial System Relief Program (CSRP) is a utility-administered demand response program serving commercial and industrial customers in upstate New York. The program offers two payment options:

1. **Reservation Payment Option:** $4.35/kW-month capacity payment + $0.50/kWh performance payment
2. **Voluntary Participation Option:** $0 capacity payment + $0.50/kWh performance payment

**Key Program Parameters:**
- Minimum capacity: 50 kW
- Advance notice: Minimum 21 hours for planned events
- Call window: 2:00 PM - 6:00 PM weekdays
- Event trigger: Day-ahead peak forecast threshold
- Performance measurement: Customer Baseline Load (CBL) methodology
- Performance requirement: >25% performance factor for Reservation Payment qualification

**Research Quality:** Payment rates are well-documented from primary sources. However, critical operational parameters (maximum events/year, event duration, historical frequency) are not publicly available, creating significant uncertainty for revenue modeling.

## Payment Structure - VERIFIED

### Reservation Payment Option
‚úì **Capacity Payment:** $4.35/kW-month
‚úì **Performance Payment:** $0.50/kWh (planned and test events)
‚úì **Source:** NYSEG official program webpage (https://www.nyseg.com/w/commercial-system-relief-program)

**Annual Revenue Example (1 MW battery, Reservation option):**
- Capacity payment: $4,350/month √ó 12 months = $52,200/year
- Performance payment: 10 events √ó 3 hours √ó 1,000 kW √ó $0.50/kWh = $15,000/year
- **Total estimated revenue: ~$67,200/year**

*Note: Performance payment estimate assumes 10 events/year at 3 hours/event, which is speculative due to lack of historical data.*

### Voluntary Participation Option
‚úì **Capacity Payment:** $0
‚úì **Performance Payment:** $0.50/kWh (all events)
‚úì **Source:** NYSEG official program webpage

**Trade-off Analysis:**
- Reservation: Guaranteed baseline revenue but performance commitment required
- Voluntary: No guaranteed income but operational flexibility for revenue stacking

## Battery-Specific Considerations

### Eligibility - UNCERTAIN
üü° **Status:** Not explicitly confirmed or excluded
Battery storage is not mentioned in program materials. Generic "commercial/industrial" and "behind-the-meter" language suggests eligibility, but explicit confirmation needed from NYSEG.

### Critical Questions for NYSEG:
1. Are behind-the-meter battery energy storage systems explicitly eligible?
2. How is CBL calculated for batteries (which don't have traditional consumption baseline)?
3. Does battery discharge count as "load reduction"?
4. Does battery charging during events disqualify performance payments?
5. What are special telemetry/control requirements for batteries?
6. How does SOC management affect the 25% performance factor requirement?
7. Can batteries participate in CSRP and NYISO wholesale markets simultaneously?

### Battery Advantages:
‚úì Fast response time (milliseconds) exceeds any program requirement
‚úì 21-hour advance notice enables optimal charge scheduling
‚úì 2-6 PM call window aligns with NYISO peak pricing
‚úì 50 kW minimum easily met by commercial batteries
‚úì Performance payment rate competitive with arbitrage spreads

### Battery Challenges:
‚ö†Ô∏è CBL methodology may not translate directly to batteries
‚ö†Ô∏è 25% performance factor may conflict with multi-use optimization
‚ö†Ô∏è Year-round availability commitment (Reservation option) limits flexibility
‚ö†Ô∏è Unknown stacking rules with NYISO markets

## Revenue Modeling Assessment

### Data Available
‚úì Capacity payment rate: $4.35/kW-month
‚úì Performance payment rate: $0.50/kWh
‚úì Call window: 2-6 PM weekdays
‚úì Minimum notice: 21 hours

### Data NOT Available (Critical Gaps)
‚ùå Maximum events per year ‚Üí Cannot forecast annual revenue
‚ùå Historical event frequency ‚Üí No basis for probability modeling
‚ùå Typical event duration ‚Üí Cannot estimate energy throughput
‚ùå Maximum total hours ‚Üí Cannot assess capacity factor

### Revenue Uncertainty Analysis

**Scenario Analysis (1 MW battery, Reservation option):**

| Scenario | Events/Year | Hours/Event | Performance Revenue | Total Annual Revenue |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Conservative | 5 | 2 | $5,000 | $57,200 |
| Moderate | 10 | 3 | $15,000 | $67,200 |
| Aggressive | 20 | 4 | $40,000 | $92,200 |

*All scenarios include $52,200/year capacity payment*

**Conclusion:** Revenue range of $57K - $92K represents 61% uncertainty. This is too high for investment-grade modeling. Historical event data is critical.

## Comparison with Similar Programs

| Program | Utility | Capacity Rate | Performance Rate | Notice | Data Quality |
|---------|---------|---------------|------------------|--------|--------------|
| **NYSEG CSRP** | NYSEG | $4.35/kW-mo | $0.50/kWh | 21 hrs | 5/10 |
| **Central Hudson CSRP** | Central Hudson | $4.00/kW-mo | $0.25-$1.00/kWh | 21 hrs | 6/10 |
| **RG&E CSRP** | RG&E | $4.35/kW-mo | $0.50/kWh | 21 hrs | Similar |

**Findings:**
- NYSEG and RG&E (sister utilities under Avangrid) have identical rate structures
- Central Hudson offers higher performance rates for unplanned events ($1.00/kWh)
- All NY utility CSRP programs use similar structure: CBL methodology, 21-hour notice, 2-6 PM windows
- Data quality issues are consistent across NY utility programs

## Data Quality Assessment

| Category | Score | Justification |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Payment Rates | 9/10 | Clearly documented from primary source |
| Eligibility | 7/10 | General requirements clear, battery-specific unclear |
| Event Parameters | 2/10 | Trigger confirmed but frequency/duration unknown |
| Operational Details | 3/10 | Basic structure known, specifics missing |
| Historical Data | 0/10 | No historical event data found |
| Battery Compatibility | 4/10 | Generic eligibility but no battery-specific guidance |

**Overall Score: 5/10**

**Justification:** Payment structure is well-documented and verified from authoritative sources. Basic program parameters (notice, call window, eligibility) are confirmed. However, critical operational parameters needed for revenue modeling (event frequency, duration limits, historical patterns) are not publicly available. Battery-specific eligibility and CBL methodology require direct confirmation from NYSEG.

## Critical Uncertainties for Battery Optimization

### HIGH PRIORITY (Blocking)
‚ùå **Historical event frequency** - Cannot forecast revenue without this
‚ùå **Maximum events/hours per year** - Cannot assess annual revenue potential
‚ùå **Battery eligibility** - Cannot enroll without confirmation
‚ùå **CBL methodology for batteries** - Cannot predict performance payments

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Important)
üü° **Event duration distribution** - Affects SOC management strategy
üü° **NYISO market stacking rules** - Determines multi-use optimization potential
üü° **Penalty structure** - Affects risk assessment
üü° **Performance factor calculation** - May conflict with multi-use operation

### LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)
‚ö™ **API availability** - Automated dispatch would be convenient
‚ö™ **Program history** - Helps assess stability
‚ö™ **Notification methods** - Operational detail

## Investment Recommendation

**Status:** üü° PROMISING BUT INCOMPLETE DATA

**Recommendation:**
NYSEG CSRP appears to be a solid utility DR program with competitive payment rates ($4.35/kW-month capacity + $0.50/kWh performance) and battery-friendly operational windows (2-6 PM weekdays with 21-hour notice). However, the absence of historical event frequency data and unclear battery eligibility create too much uncertainty for investment-grade modeling at this time.

**Action Plan:**
1. Contact NYSEG demand response team to obtain:
   - Historical event data (2022-2024)
   - Battery eligibility confirmation
   - Maximum events/hours limits
   - CBL methodology for batteries

2. If historical data shows 15+ events/year at 3+ hours/event, program becomes attractive:
   - Reservation option: ~$67K/year for 1 MW battery
   - Good alignment with NYISO peak pricing
   - Strong compatibility with energy arbitrage

3. If event frequency is <10/year or battery eligibility issues exist, program is less attractive:
   - Performance revenue too low to justify complexity
   - Better to focus on NYISO energy/AS markets

**Timeline:** Complete data collection within 4 weeks. Reassess with complete information.
