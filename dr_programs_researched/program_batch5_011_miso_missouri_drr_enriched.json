  "description": "Demand Response Resources (DRR) Type I and Type II are MISO's energy market demand response programs that allow resources to participate economically in day-ahead and real-time energy markets. Unlike LMRs which are capacity resources, DRRs are dispatched based on economic signals when locational marginal prices exceed the Net Benefit Price Threshold (NBPT). DRR Type I resources cannot follow dispatch instructions (e.g., utility interruptible load programs), while DRR Type II resources can receive and follow MISO operator instructions (e.g., behind-the-meter generation). DRRs cleared in the Planning Resource Auction have a must-offer obligation in the day-ahead energy market.",

    "notes": "BATTERY SUITABILITY ASSESSMENT: DRR program has LIMITED SUITABILITY for battery energy storage systems due to the following factors: (1) 1 MW minimum threshold is accessible for utility-scale batteries, (2) DRR Type II allows following dispatch instructions which suits battery operational capabilities, (3) Energy-only payments based on LMP when LMP > NBPT ($28-52/MWh) provides economic dispatch opportunities, (4) Can participate in Spinning Reserve market for additional revenue, (5) 5-minute dispatch granularity aligns with battery response capabilities. HOWEVER, MAJOR LIMITATIONS EXIST: (1) Payment only when LMP exceeds NBPT means many hours may have zero revenue, (2) NBPT range of $28-52/MWh is relatively low compared to battery operational costs including degradation, (3) 40%+ non-performance penalty concerns indicate regulatory scrutiny on DR resources, (4) Low participation (only 79 MW registered as DRR Type II) suggests limited market attractiveness, (5) Cannot provide Energy and Contingency Reserve simultaneously (Type I restriction). RECOMMENDATION: Batteries should evaluate Electric Storage Resource (ESR) model instead, which provides full energy market participation without NBPT limitations and allows participation in all ancillary service markets. DRR model better suited for traditional load curtailment or behind-the-meter diesel generation rather than batteries. If pursuing DRR, must register as Type II to follow dispatch instructions."
