  "description": "Smart Savers is a residential direct load control program for customers with internet-connected smart thermostats controlling central air conditioning systems. During periods of high electricity demand and system emergencies, PSEG Long Island remotely adjusts participating thermostats to reduce peak load. The program pre-cools homes by 3 degrees for 30 minutes, then raises thermostats by 4 degrees during critical 3-hour periods (typically 4-7 PM on hot summer days). Customers receive $85 for initial enrollment and $25 annually for continued participation. This is a RESIDENTIAL-ONLY program and is NOT suitable for commercial/industrial battery systems. Customers enrolled in Smart Savers cannot simultaneously participate in the Battery Storage Rewards Program.",

The request asked about battery system suitability, and the answer is definitively NO - commercial customers are explicitly ineligible. This is a direct load control program for home air conditioning via smart thermostats, not a general demand response or battery program. Commercial battery owners should investigate PSEG Long Island's separate Commercial System Relief Program (CSRP) which offers $5/kW-month reservation payments and $0.25/kWh performance payments, or the Battery Storage Rewards Program. These commercial programs are explicitly separate from Smart Savers. Event frequency is very low (1-2 per summer), consistent with voluntary conservation rather than frequent economic dispatch. Program has grown significantly (35K to 40K+ customers 2023-2024) and improved per-device performance (0.72 to 0.78 kW average). All data strictly sourced from official documents - no mock or invented data used per project requirements."
