  "description": "CenterPoint Energy's Commercial Load Management Program is a 24/7 demand response program that pays non-residential customers up to $40 per kW for verified curtailed load during grid emergencies. The program operates year-round with both scheduled and unscheduled curtailment events triggered by ERCOT level 2 events or CenterPoint system emergencies. Participants receive 30-minute notification and must curtail at least 50 kW of load. Notably, there are no penalties for non-participation in events, making this a low-risk, high-value program for customers with flexible loads or behind-the-meter generation/storage capabilities.",

The main uncertainties are: (1) Actual event frequency (unknown how many events occur per year historically), (2) Baseline calculation methodology details, (3) Whether payments are made on committed capacity or actual performance. The program's ERCOT level 2 trigger suggests events correlate with high real-time prices, creating potential for dual revenue streams (DR payment + energy arbitrage). Battery systems should be sized to deliver at least 50 kW for 1-4 hours to capture full program value."

NOTE: Task description stated $30/kW and 100 kW minimum, but the official source clearly states $40/kW and 50 kW minimum - I used the verified official values. The 'up to $40/kW' language suggests payment may be performance-based rather than a flat capacity payment, but this is not explicitly clarified. The no-penalty structure is highly unusual for utility DR programs and represents a significant value proposition. The program appears designed for customers with flexible loads, backup generation, or battery storage who can respond quickly but may not want to commit to mandatory participation. For battery optimization: The 30-minute response time, 50 kW minimum, and no-penalty structure make this ideal for behind-the-meter battery systems. The main optimization challenge is that event frequency is unknown, making it difficult to forecast annual revenue. However, the correlation with ERCOT emergencies suggests events would align with high-price periods, potentially enabling dual revenue from DR payments and energy arbitrage.

Recommend contacting them to obtain: (1) Historical event data, (2) Baseline methodology details, (3) Enrollment process, (4) Whether API-based notification is available for automated systems."
