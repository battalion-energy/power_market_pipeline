  "description": "MISO operates three wholesale demand response program types available to Louisiana participants: (1) Load Modifying Resources (LMR) - capacity market program providing capacity payments for resources that can reduce load during emergency events (NERC EEA Level 2/3), (2) Demand Response Resources Type I and II (DRR-I, DRR-II) - energy market programs allowing economic dispatch for load reduction or behind-the-meter generation, and (3) Emergency Demand Response (EDR) - emergency reliability program being eliminated in 2025/26 planning year. LMRs represent approximately 95% of MISO's DR resources. MISO is implementing major reforms for 2028/29 planning year including tiered accreditation based on notification times (30 minutes to 6 hours) with corresponding capacity credits (50%-100%), enhanced performance penalties (VOLL × MW shortfall), and stricter testing requirements. Louisiana is in MISO South region (Zone 9, former Entergy Louisiana territory) which has experienced significant capacity price volatility: $60/MW-day (Fall 2023), $30/MW-day (Summer 2024), and $666.50/MW-day (Summer 2025).

DRR Type II well-suited for sophisticated battery systems with telemetry/controls - can stack energy arbitrage, operating reserves, and capacity (via separate LMR registration). DRR-I less suitable (limited control). Challenge: NBPT threshold ($28-52/MWh) limits DRR energy market participation to high-price periods only. Opportunity: Capacity price volatility ($30 to $666.50/MW-day 2024-2025) creates arbitrage opportunity if can predict PRA outcomes. Risk: High penalties for LMR non-performance (VOLL × MW shortfall = up to $10,000/MWh × MW).

Post-Hurricane Ida focus on resilience creates policy support for DR but also highlights emergency reliability obligations.

MISO operates most complex wholesale DR structure in US with three distinct program types serving different market functions. Key findings: (1) Extreme capacity price volatility in Louisiana Zone 9: $30/MW-day (2024) to $666.50/MW-day (2025) summer, creating significant revenue opportunity but forecasting challenge. (2) Major LMR reforms for 2028/29: tiered accreditation, 30-minute vs 6-hour notification types, VOLL-based penalties ($10,000/MWh × MW shortfall). (3) Louisiana-specific barrier: State regulators require participation through Entergy, blocking third-party aggregators like Voltus/Enel/CPower. (4) Battery storage well-suited technically (fast response, dispatch following capability) but faces Louisiana market access constraints. (5) DRR Type II best program fit for batteries - energy arbitrage + reserves + capacity stack possible. (6) NBPT threshold ($28-52/MWh) limits DRR energy participation to high-price periods. (7) Post-Hurricane Ida grid resilience considerations important for Louisiana context. (8) FERC Order 2222 DER aggregation delayed until 2027-2030, creating uncertainty for virtual power plant models. Data quality strong on capacity pricing and program structures, moderate on historical dispatch and Louisiana implementation specifics. Recommend direct engagement with Entergy Louisiana and MISO for operational details.",

Medium confidence on: (1) Louisiana-specific implementation details due to inaccessible Entergy tariff, (2) Historical dispatch frequencies (not published by MISO), (3) NBPT historical values (only range provided), (4) Order 2222 specifications (still evolving). Low confidence on: (1) Actual battery storage participation rates in Louisiana (data not available), (2) Future capacity price forecasts (extreme recent volatility).
