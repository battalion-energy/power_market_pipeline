  "description": "MISO operates three primary demand response programs available to Iowa participants: (1) Load Modifying Resources (LMR) - a capacity market program providing zonal resource credits for reducing load during emergencies with seasonal capacity payments; (2) Demand Response Resources (DRR) - an energy market program providing LMP-based payments when real-time prices exceed the Net Benefits Price Threshold; and (3) Emergency Demand Response (EDR) - an emergency reliability program being phased out with dual LMR/EDR registration eliminated for Planning Year 2026-27. Iowa is primarily located in MISO Local Resource Zone 3 (LRZ 3), with major utilities including MidAmerican Energy (Berkshire Hathaway) and Alliant Energy. The state has high wind penetration and is seeing increased battery storage deployment. Since 2019, MISO demand response resources have received $800 million in capacity payments across all zones.",

Iowa Utilities Board reconsidering ARC aggregator participation (proceedings initiated March 2025) which could significantly expand market access. MidAmerican Energy and Alliant Energy have established DR program experience. MISO's seasonal construct (approved 2022) creates four distinct capacity seasons with different pricing - summer 2025-26 at $666.50/MW-day represents major revenue opportunity. Independent Market Monitor oversight ensures program integrity but also flags performance issues (>40% DRR Type I inadequate performance in 2023-24). Battery participants should focus on LMR for capacity revenue or DRR for energy arbitrage - EDR not recommended due to phase-out."
