CRITICAL LIMITATION: Geographic availability extremely limited - only Big Rivers Electric Corporation territory qualifies, as LG&E and KU withdrew from MISO in 2006. Must-offer requirements may reduce scheduling flexibility if resource clears capacity auction. NBPT ($28-$52/MWh) creates payment threshold that may limit revenue opportunities during low-price hours. Recent enforcement actions and enhanced monitoring requirements increase compliance burden but improve market integrity. Enhanced meter data requirements (hourly data for 45 days, updated bi-weekly) require robust metering infrastructure. Proposed reforms to prohibit offers below NBPT may further constrain bidding strategies. Market participation declining due to enforcement - total DRR payments only $4.8M in 2024. Strong API integration available for automated dispatch. Recommend detailed analysis of NBPT impact on revenues and confirmation of Big Rivers service territory before optimization investment."

While MISO has robust and well-documented demand response programs with strong battery suitability, the geographic availability is extremely limited due to LG&E and KU's 2006 withdrawal from MISO. Only Big Rivers Electric Corporation service territory participates. This finding should be prominently featured in any Kentucky battery optimization analysis. Data quality is high (8.5/10) with comprehensive official documentation from MISO stakeholder meetings, business practices manuals, auction results, and FERC filings. All pricing data is actual auction results (not estimates). Program rules are clearly documented in BPM-026. Recent reform initiatives (2024-2025) indicate active program evolution with focus on preventing market manipulation and improving performance accountability. The 22x capacity price increase from 2024-25 to 2025-26 reflects MISO's new RBDC methodology and tightening reserves, creating significant revenue opportunity for qualified participants. However, geographic limitation remains the dominant consideration for Kentucky applications."
