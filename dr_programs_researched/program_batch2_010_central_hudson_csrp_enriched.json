  "description": "Central Hudson's Commercial System Relief Program (CSRP) is a utility demand response program that pays commercial and industrial customers to reduce electricity usage during peak demand periods. The program operates during the summer season (June 1 through September 30) and offers two distinct enrollment options: a Reservation Payment option with monthly capacity payments and lower performance rates, and a Voluntary Payment option with no capacity payments but higher performance rates for unplanned events. Participants must respond to events called Monday through Friday between 12:00 PM and 8:00 PM, with events lasting up to 4 hours. The program uses Customer Baseline Load (CBL) methodology to calculate actual load reductions. Customers in transmission-constrained areas eligible for the Targeted Demand Response (TDR) program are not eligible for CSRP.",

  "research_notes": "Conducted comprehensive web research on Central Hudson's Commercial System Relief Program (CSRP) on 2025-10-11. Research included Central Hudson official sources, NYSERDA technical documents, application forms, tariff references, and comparable New York utility programs (NYSEG, RGE, National Grid). The program has excellent documentation for its dual payment structure: the NYSERDA Energy Storage Fact Sheet provided detailed payment rates for both Reservation Payment and Voluntary Payment options, which is the most critical data for battery optimization modeling. Key finding: the program offers two distinct risk-reward profiles - Reservation option ($4/kW/month capacity + $0.25-0.50/kWh performance) vs Voluntary option ($0 capacity + $0.25-1.00/kWh performance). The 2x higher unplanned event rate ($1.00/kWh) under Voluntary option is notable for fast-responding batteries. Program structure is typical for New York utilities participating in NYISO demand response. Call window (12-8 PM weekdays) aligns well with summer peak pricing periods. Major data gaps include maximum event frequency/duration limits, which are critical for revenue forecasting and state-of-charge management. The mutual exclusivity with TDR program is important - TDR offers higher capacity payments ($27.30/kW/summer) but serves only transmission-constrained areas. Overall data quality is good for payment structure but moderate for operational parameters. Direct contact with Central Hudson (CH.DLM@cenhud.com) or obtaining complete tariff PDF would be needed for comprehensive operational details.",

Batteries can optimize by: (1) charging overnight/morning off-peak, (2) being available for CSRP events 12-8 PM, (3) potentially capturing energy arbitrage in non-event hours. 4-hour maximum event duration is well-suited for 4-hour batteries.",
      "seasonal_constraints": "June 1 - September 30 season (4 months) limits annual revenue potential. Battery must optimize across CSRP + energy arbitrage + potential other revenue streams in Oct-May off-season. Summer-only operation simplifies scheduling but limits total annual earnings.",
      "notice_period_optimization": "Dual-tier notice structure (21+ hours planned vs <21 hours unplanned) with higher unplanned rates rewards fast-responding resources. Batteries with automated control systems can capture the higher $0.50-1.00/kWh unplanned rates more effectively than manual curtailment resources.",
      "revenue_uncertainty": "Lack of published maximum events/hours per season creates revenue modeling uncertainty. If program calls 5-10 events per summer at 3-4 hours each, revenue potential is moderate. Need historical event data for accurate forecasting.",
      "stacking_opportunities": "CSRP operates 12-8 PM weekdays June-Sept. Battery can potentially stack: (1) CSRP capacity/performance payments, (2) NYISO energy arbitrage in non-event hours, (3) NYISO ancillary services (regulation, reserves) when not in CSRP events, (4) demand charge management for host facility. Must verify program rules allow revenue stacking.",
      "key_question": "Is the battery eligible for both CSRP and NYISO wholesale markets simultaneously, or is CSRP participation exclusive? This is critical for revenue optimization modeling."
    },
    "battery_specific_notes": "Program does not explicitly exclude or confirm battery energy storage system (BESS) eligibility. Generic 'behind-the-meter' language suggests batteries are eligible. Communicating interval meter requirement is standard for batteries. The 50 kW minimum (inferred) is easily met by commercial/industrial batteries. Fast response time (batteries can respond in seconds) is advantageous for capturing higher-paying unplanned events. 4-hour maximum event duration matches common 4-hour battery configurations. CBL methodology for batteries may need special handling since batteries don't have traditional consumption baseline - verification needed. Recommend confirming with Central Hudson: (1) explicit battery eligibility, (2) CBL calculation for batteries, (3) whether discharge-only or charge-and-discharge operations both qualify, (4) any special telemetry or control requirements for batteries, (5) compatibility with simultaneous NYISO wholesale market participation.",
    "notes": "Central Hudson CSRP is a well-structured program with clear dual payment options that create different optimization strategies for battery operators. The Voluntary Payment option's $1.00/kWh unplanned event rate is among the highest found in utility DR programs and particularly attractive for batteries with fast response capability. The weekday-only, summer-only structure and 12-8 PM call window align well with peak price periods in NYISO. Main limitations for optimization modeling are: (1) uncertainty about maximum events/hours per season, (2) lack of historical event frequency data, (3) need to confirm battery eligibility and CBL calculation methodology, (4) uncertainty about revenue stacking with NYISO markets. Recommend prioritizing contact with Central Hudson to obtain historical event data and confirm battery-specific program rules before building optimization model. Overall: Good candidate program for battery optimization with strong performance rates, but need more operational details for accurate revenue forecasting."
