  "description": "The Power Partner Thermostat Program is a voluntary demand response program for residential customers and small businesses with smart thermostats. During peak demand periods (typically hot summer afternoons), Austin Energy remotely adjusts enrolled thermostats by a few degrees to reduce electricity demand and strain on the grid. This is distinct from Austin Energy's Commercial Demand Response Program, which is for larger commercial/industrial facilities and involves broader load reduction strategies beyond just thermostats.",
