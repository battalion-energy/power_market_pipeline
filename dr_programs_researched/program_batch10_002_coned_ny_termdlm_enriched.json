  "description": "Con Edison's Term-DLM and Auto-DLM are long-term contract-based demand response programs established by the New York Public Service Commission in September 2020. Term-DLM is a day-ahead peak-shaving program requiring 21 hours advance notice, while Auto-DLM is a rapid-response program requiring only 10 minutes advance notice. Both programs offer 3-5 year contracts providing longer-term price certainty compared to tariff-based programs like CSRP. These programs were designed to drive investment in energy storage and other long-term demand response resources by providing multi-year revenue commitments.",

The programs were specifically designed by NY PSC in 2020 to incentivize energy storage deployment with multi-year contracts (3-5 years) providing revenue certainty. Key advantages for BESS: (1) Dual revenue streams - Term-DLM for day-ahead arbitrage optimization (21-hour notice) plus Auto-DLM for premium rapid-response revenue (10-minute notice), (2) Long-term contracts eliminate annual rate uncertainty present in tariff programs like CSRP, (3) Competitive bidding allows sophisticated battery operators to value their flexibility appropriately, (4) Performance payments of $1/kWh for both programs on top of capacity payments, (5) Bonus $5/kW-month when 5+ events called, (6) 4-hour duration aligns perfectly with typical BESS configurations, (7) Technology-agnostic (diesel excluded) but batteries explicitly encouraged, (8) Can stack with other programs under certain conditions, (9) Summer-only season (May-Sept) matches peak arbitrage opportunities. 2024 performance data shows strong program maturity: 708 Term-DLM enrollments delivering 158% of pledged capacity and 4 Auto-DLM enrollments delivering 112% of pledged. For Tier 2 networks, capacity payments likely range $15-25/kW-month based on CSRP+DLRP benchmarks. A 1MW/4MWh system could generate $180K-300K/year in capacity payments alone, plus $20K-40K in performance payments from 5-10 events. The 10-minute response for Auto-DLM is ideal for battery systems and commands premium pricing. Minimum 50 kW threshold easily met by commercial BESS."
