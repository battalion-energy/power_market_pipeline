  "description": "Load Modifying Resources (LMR-DR) is MISO's capacity market demand response program available to commercial and industrial customers in Missouri. LMRs are Planning Resources that help Load Serving Entities meet their Planning Reserve Margin Requirements by reducing load during emergency conditions. Resources receive capacity payments through MISO's Planning Resource Auction (PRA) and are obligated to respond during Energy Emergency Alerts. MISO is implementing reforms to create LMR Type I (6-hour notification) and LMR Type II (30-minute notification) effective Planning Year 2028-2029.",

IMPORTANT: Battery systems participating as LMR cannot simultaneously participate as Electric Storage Resources (ESR) in energy markets - must choose one participation model. Front-of-meter batteries should consider ESR model instead for energy market participation. CAUTION: Missouri Zone 5 capacity prices are highly volatile - ranged from $10/MW-day (2023-2024 Spring) to $719.81/MW-day (2024-2025 Fall/Spring) to $666.50/MW-day (2025-2026 Summer). This volatility creates revenue uncertainty for long-term project financing."
