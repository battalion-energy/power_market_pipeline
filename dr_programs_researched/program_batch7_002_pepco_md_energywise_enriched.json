The 77-82% value gap represents Pepco's profit margin on DR aggregation. Battery storage systems that can access PJM markets directly will capture 9-10x more revenue than equivalent capacity enrolled in utility DR programs, making direct PJM participation the clear optimal strategy for battery projects in Pepco Maryland territory."
