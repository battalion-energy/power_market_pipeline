TVA serves 16 Alabama counties through 17 municipalities and 8 cooperatively owned power companies, covering 8,360 square miles and 461,000 households. The portfolio includes Peak Rewards (50 kW minimum), PowerFlex (1 MW minimum), and legacy Interruptible Power programs (IP5, IP30). All programs are managed by Enel North America and provide payments for load curtailment during peak demand periods. Battery energy storage systems are eligible to participate through load curtailment or backup generation strategies.",

    "notes": "Comprehensive research completed on TVA demand response programs for Alabama. Data quality is good (7/10) with strong documentation of program parameters, eligibility, event characteristics, and Alabama-specific geography. Primary limitation is lack of publicly available payment rate schedules - TVA's Schedule of Credits and Charges is distributed to participants and local power companies but not published online. Historical event data provides valuable context for actual program utilization. Battery suitability is high due to adequate notification times (30 minutes), moderate annual hours (32), and sophisticated aggregator support through Enel. Alabama service territory clearly defined (16 northern counties, 461,000 households). Multiple program tiers accommodate different facility sizes from 50 kW to multi-MW installations. Strong program commitment with $1.5B investment through 2027 and 108% performance vs targets indicate mature, reliable program suitable for long-term battery investment planning."
