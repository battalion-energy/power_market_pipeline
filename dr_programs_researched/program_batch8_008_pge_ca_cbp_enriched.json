  "battery_suitability": {
    "rating": "Excellent",
    "justification": "Battery storage is highly suitable for CBP due to: (1) Day-ahead notification (by 5 PM) provides sufficient time for battery scheduling and SOC management; (2) 4-hour maximum event duration aligns well with typical commercial battery systems (2-4 hour duration); (3) Program explicitly allows all customer types including Net metered and Auto DR, indicating technology-agnostic approach; (4) No minimum load per customer (only 100 kW aggregate PDR requirement) enables smaller batteries to participate via aggregation; (5) Battery can precisely control discharge to stay below FSL, minimizing penalty risk; (6) Integration with CAISO wholesale markets (PDR) means batteries can potentially stack value with energy arbitrage and ancillary services; (7) Summer-only program (May-Oct) aligns with peak demand season when battery economics are strongest; (8) Aggregator model provides professional management of complex CAISO market interactions; (9) 15-minute interval metering matches battery telemetry capabilities; (10) FSL baseline methodology (85% of peak demand) is favorable for batteries which can reliably deliver full nameplate discharge capacity."

  "research_notes": "Key findings: (1) CBP is fundamentally a wholesale market participation program - aggregators bid customer load reductions into CAISO day-ahead PDR market; (2) Specific $/kW capacity rates are CPUC-approved but not disclosed in web sources, likely vary based on market conditions; CAISO system capacity exceeded $13/kW-month in 2023; (3) Energy payments similarly not disclosed but tied to CAISO market clearing prices; (4) FSL penalty structure ($6/kWh for over-consumption) creates strong incentive for precise load reduction - batteries excel at this precision; (5) Program operates May-October only, no winter events; (6) Aggregator bears financial risk and manages CAISO complexity, making this accessible to customers; (7) CAISO PDR minimum 100 kW enables small batteries to participate via aggregation; (8) Program integrates with broader CAISO demand response ecosystem including resource adequacy; (9) No explicit battery storage exclusions found; residential eligibility suggests behind-the-meter systems are allowed; (10) Relationship to other PG&E programs unclear - customers should evaluate CBP vs Base Interruptible Program vs direct CAISO participation vs retail arbitrage opportunities. Alternative consideration: Larger battery systems (>1 MW) might achieve better economics through direct CAISO market participation as non-generator resources (NGR) or Proxy Demand Resources rather than through utility aggregator programs.",

  "research_quality_score": 6,
  "research_quality_notes": "Moderate completeness: (1) Program structure, eligibility, and event parameters well documented; (2) Critical gap: specific capacity payment rates ($/kW-month) not accessible - Schedule E-CBP PDF could not be extracted; (3) Critical gap: energy payment rates ($/kWh) not disclosed in public sources; (4) Baseline methodology inferred from similar programs but CBP-specific FSL calculation details not confirmed; (5) CAISO PDR context well researched with CPM soft offer cap ($7.34/kW-month) providing benchmark; (6) Battery eligibility inferred from program design and lack of exclusions rather than explicit statement; (7) Aggregator compensation structure confirmed but rates are privately negotiated; (8) No customer case studies or actual participation data found; (9) Tariff document exists but specific rates require direct access to readable PDF; (10) Score of 6/10 reflects good understanding of program mechanics but missing critical financial details needed for ROI analysis."
