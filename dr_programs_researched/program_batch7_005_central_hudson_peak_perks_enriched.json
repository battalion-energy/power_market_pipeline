  "description": "Central Hudson Peak Perks is an umbrella demand response platform serving customers in energy-constrained areas of the Hudson Valley. The program offers multiple participation pathways: (1) Residential Peak Perks for homeowners with smart thermostats, outdoor AC switches, and a custom savings program based on voluntary load reductions; (2) Commercial System Relief Program (CSRP) for C&I customers with 50kW+ curtailment capacity; (3) Targeted Demand Response (TDR) for C&I customers in transmission-constrained zones. The residential programs operate June-September, focus on AC cycling during 2-4 hour events between noon-8PM on weekdays, and offer annual rewards of $75-200 depending on device type and energy savings. Battery energy storage systems are NOT explicitly mentioned in any current Peak Perks residential offering, representing a significant gap compared to VPP programs at other utilities. The program is distinct from but complementary to NYISO wholesale market programs.",

  "research_notes": "Conducted comprehensive research on Central Hudson Peak Perks program on 2025-10-11, building on prior Batch 2 research of TDR and CSRP programs. Key findings: (1) Peak Perks is an umbrella brand, not a distinct program - it houses residential programs (thermostats, outdoor switches, custom savings) and commercial programs (TDR, CSRP). (2) CRITICAL GAP: NO residential battery storage program exists in Peak Perks, unlike VPP programs at other NY utilities (e.g., National Grid). This represents a significant missed opportunity for residential solar+storage optimization. (3) Commercial batteries (≥50kW) likely eligible for TDR or CSRP, but critical details not documented (CBL for batteries, performance rates for TDR, NYISO stacking for CSRP). (4) Payment structure well-documented for residential programs ($75/year) and CSRP ($0.25-1.00/kWh performance), but TDR performance rates not public. (5) NYISO interaction complex: TDR explicitly allows SCR stacking, but CSRP stacking unclear. FERC 2222 aggregation enables residential battery participation in NYISO wholesale markets (bypassing Peak Perks). (6) Event parameters well-defined (noon-8PM weekdays, June-Sept), but max events/hours not specified - critical gap for battery SOC management. (7) All Peak Perks programs use summer-only, weekday-only structure aligned with NYISO peak periods. (8) Geographic targeting to transmission-constrained zones (TDR) vs broader territory (CSRP, residential) creates complexity. Overall: Peak Perks is mature residential/commercial DR platform with clear payment structures, but lacks battery-specific pathways and has critical data gaps for battery revenue modeling. Residential battery owners have no Peak Perks option and must pursue NYISO aggregation or forgo DR revenue. Commercial battery eligibility implied but not explicit. Recommend: (1) Direct engagement with Central Hudson to confirm battery eligibility and obtain missing operational parameters, (2) Advocate for residential battery VPP program addition to Peak Perks, (3) Investigate NYISO FERC 2222 aggregation as alternative pathway for batteries.",

    "notes": "Central Hudson Peak Perks is a mature demand response platform with clear residential (thermostat, outdoor switch, custom savings) and commercial (TDR, CSRP) offerings, but LACKS battery storage pathways available at other utilities. The residential battery gap is particularly notable - utilities across North America are launching battery VPP programs, but Peak Perks has no equivalent offering. Commercial battery participation is implied but not explicit, with critical data gaps (CBL methodology, max events, NYISO stacking for CSRP) that create revenue modeling uncertainty. Payment structure is well-documented for CSRP ($0.25-1.00/kWh performance) and TDR capacity ($27.30/kW/summer), but TDR performance rates are not public. The program's summer-only, weekday noon-8PM structure aligns well with NYISO peak periods for arbitrage opportunities. NYISO interaction is partially documented: TDR explicitly allows SCR stacking, but CSRP stacking unclear. FERC 2222 aggregation (effective July 2023) enables residential battery participation in NYISO wholesale markets as alternative to non-existent Peak Perks battery program. For optimization modeling: residential batteries have NO Peak Perks pathway (pursue NYISO aggregation instead); commercial batteries 50kW-1MW should consider CSRP Voluntary for high unplanned event rates ($1.00/kWh) leveraging fast response; batteries >1MW have strong multi-market stacking potential (TDR + NYISO DSASP + arbitrage) but need complex control systems. Critical next step: direct engagement with Central Hudson to confirm battery eligibility, obtain CBL methodology for batteries, clarify NYISO stacking rules, and advocate for residential battery VPP program launch. Overall assessment: Peak Perks is good residential/commercial DR platform, but battery-specific capabilities are underdeveloped compared to industry peers. Battery revenue modeling faces significant data gaps (no residential program, TDR performance rates unpublished, max events unknown, historical data unavailable, CBL for batteries undefined)."

CRITICAL FINDING: No residential battery storage program exists in Peak Perks - this is a significant gap compared to VPP programs at other NY utilities. Commercial battery eligibility implied but not explicit, with critical data gaps for revenue modeling (CBL methodology for batteries, TDR performance rates, max events/hours, NYISO stacking rules for CSRP).
