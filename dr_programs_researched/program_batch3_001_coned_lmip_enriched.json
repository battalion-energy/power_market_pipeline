  "description": "CRITICAL FINDING: The term 'Load Management Incentive Program' does NOT appear to exist as a standalone demand response program at Con Edison. The URL provided leads to the Commercial & Industrial Energy Efficiency Program, which offers one-time equipment rebates for energy-efficient equipment (HVAC, chillers, etc.), NOT ongoing demand response payments. Con Edison's actual demand response programs are called 'Smart Usage Rewards' and include DLRP (Distribution Load Relief Program) and CSRP (Commercial System Relief Program). Historical records show Con Edison offered thermal storage incentives through 2016 ($2,600/kW) but this appears discontinued. Current program focuses on equipment efficiency rebates (prescriptive and custom paths) with no specific thermal storage or load management equipment incentives listed in 2025 program materials.",

Those programs offer $18-25/kW-month capacity payments plus $1/kWh performance payments during events. The 'Load Management Incentive Program' name does not appear in any current Con Edison materials - it may be legacy terminology from the discontinued thermal storage program (ended 2016). For battery optimization purposes, you should investigate Smart Usage Rewards programs instead (see program_batch2_004_coned_dlrp_enriched.json)."
