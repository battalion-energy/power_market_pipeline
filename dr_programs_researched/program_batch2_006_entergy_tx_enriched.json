Research findings: 1) Original URL provided returns 404 error, 2) Load Management Handbook PDFs (2022 and 2025) could not be accessed due to DNS resolution failures, 3) Tariff PDFs (MVDR, IS) were not readable through web research tools, 4) No publicly indexed information contains the specific program parameters mentioned ($32.50/kW, event structure), 5) Entergy Texas does offer general 'cash incentives for reducing electric use during peak demand' but no specific program details are publicly available. RECOMMENDATION: This program may be discontinued, may never have existed with these specific parameters, or details may only be available through direct customer contact with Entergy Texas Business Center at 1-800-766-1648 or [email protected]. DO NOT USE THIS DATA FOR BATTERY OPTIMIZATION without first verifying program existence and details directly with Entergy Texas."

CONCLUSION: The specific program details provided by the user ($32.50/kW, 250 kW minimum, 1 scheduled + 4 unscheduled events) cannot be verified from any publicly accessible source. Entergy Texas does appear to offer some form of load management or demand response program for business customers, but the specific structure, payment rates, and event parameters are not publicly documented in accessible formats.",

Do not use this data for financial analysis or battery optimization without direct verification from Entergy Texas.",
