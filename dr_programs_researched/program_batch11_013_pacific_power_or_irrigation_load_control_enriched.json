Program operates in partnership with Connected Energy and serves approximately 13,000 irrigation customers in Oregon and Washington. Participants must curtail irrigation load during mandatory events with 4-hour minimum notice, with optional participation in voluntary events. The program uses a pay-for-performance structure based on average available load (kW) that enrolled pumps can reliably shut off during program hours.",

Batteries cannot participate as they do not meet the agricultural irrigation customer class requirements and do not operate irrigation pumps.

The program name, eligibility requirements, and resource types all confirm this is exclusively for farm irrigation operations. No revenue potential exists for battery systems in this program. Data quality score of 6 reflects good information about program structure and historical performance (5 events in 2023, $100K+ paid out, historical rates of $30-45/kW), but lacks publicly available current 2024-2025 specific $/kW rates and detailed event history.
