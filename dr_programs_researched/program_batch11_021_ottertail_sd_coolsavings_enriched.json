Battery energy storage systems are NOT eligible. The program uses direct load control to cycle AC equipment on/off every 15 minutes during peak demand. No provisions exist for battery participation, charging, or discharging. This is identical to the Minnesota CoolSavings program (Index 50) - residential AC cycling only.",

    "notes": "BATTERY SUITABILITY: N/A - AC load control program only. PAYMENT STRUCTURE: Residential customers receive $8.25/month during June-September (4 months = $33/year maximum per household). Commercial customers receive $6/ton of connected cooling/month during the same period. ELIGIBILITY: Requires central cooling system with exterior disconnect box. Excludes window units and ductless mini-splits. Company installs control receiver at no cost. LIMITATIONS FOR BATTERY ANALYSIS: No battery participation possible. This is a legacy direct load control program targeting residential and small commercial AC loads only. DATA QUALITY: Limited historical event data publicly available. Only one recent event (October 2025) was found, which occurred outside the typical June-September season, suggesting the program may also activate during shoulder months. No multi-year event statistics publicly available. Tariff document 14.08 (Air Conditioning Control Rider) referenced but PDF not accessible via web search."
