## Executive Summary

Con Edison's Term Dynamic Load Management (Term-DLM) and Auto Dynamic Load Management (Auto-DLM) programs are long-term, contract-based demand response programs established by the New York Public Service Commission in September 2020. These programs address the shortcoming of traditional tariff-based programs by offering 3-5 year contracts with fixed pricing, specifically designed to drive investment in energy storage and other capital-intensive demand response resources.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Term-DLM:** Day-ahead program requiring 21 hours advance notice
- **Auto-DLM:** Rapid-response program requiring only 10 minutes advance notice

Both programs use competitive pay-as-bid procurement mechanisms and are valued differently: Term-DLM as CSRP equivalent, Auto-DLM as combined CSRP+DLRP capabilities.

---

## Program Overview

### Background & Purpose

The NY PSC Order of September 17, 2020 directed utilities to procure dynamic load management resources for terms of at least three years, addressing the issue that current DLM program structures "pay for yearly performance and result in a bias towards short-term, low-capital investment solutions."

**Goals:**
- Support NY's 1,500 MW energy storage target by 2025
- Provide long-term revenue certainty for capital-intensive DR resources
- Enable utility response to both forecasted peaks (Term-DLM) and real-time contingencies (Auto-DLM)
- Create competition-driven efficient pricing

### Program Structure

**Term-DLM:**
- Day-ahead peak shaving program
- 21+ hours advance notice
- 4-hour events in fixed call windows
- Weekdays only (Monday-Friday)
- Four network-specific call windows:
  - 11:00 AM - 3:00 PM
  - 2:00 PM - 6:00 PM
  - 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM
  - 7:00 PM - 11:00 PM

**Auto-DLM:**
- Rapid-response contingency program
- 10 minutes advance notice
- 4-hour events
- 18 hours/day availability (6:00 AM - midnight)
- 7 days/week (including weekends)
- Higher performance requirements = premium payments

## Comparison to Related Programs

### vs. CSRP (Commercial System Relief Program)

| Feature | CSRP | Term-DLM |
|---------|------|----------|
| Contract Type | Annual tariff | 3-5 year contract |
| Pricing Certainty | Annual changes | Multi-year fixed |
| Procurement | Open enrollment | Competitive bid |
| Notice Period | 21+ hours | 21+ hours |
| Event Days | Weekdays | Weekdays |
| Capacity Payment | $6-18/kW-month (location) | Competitive bid |
| Performance Payment | $1/kWh | $1/kWh |

### vs. DLRP (Distribution Load Relief Program)

| Feature | DLRP | Auto-DLM |
|---------|------|----------|
| Response Time | Faster than CSRP | 10 minutes |
| Availability | Limited | 18 hrs/day, 7 days/week |
| Capacity Payment | $18-25/kW-month (tier) | Competitive bid (premium) |
| Performance Payment | $1/kWh | $1/kWh |

**Key Insight:** Auto-DLM combines the load relief capability of CSRP with the rapid-response capability of DLRP, hence it is valued as the combined value of both programs when evaluating bids.

## Payment Structure

### Verified Payment Components

1. **Capacity Payment (Reservation Payment)**
   - Determined through competitive pay-as-bid procurement
   - Applicants submit their own $/kW-month bid
   - Term-DLM: Valued similarly to CSRP ($6-18/kW-month benchmark)
   - Auto-DLM: Premium above CSRP+DLRP combined value (specific premium not disclosed)
   - **CRITICAL:** Specific clearing prices are NOT publicly disclosed

2. **Performance Payment**
   - **$1.00/kWh** for actual load reduction delivered during events
   - Same rate for both Term-DLM and Auto-DLM
   - Fully verified across multiple sources

3. **Bonus Payment**
   - **+$5.00/kW-month** increase in reservation payment
   - Triggered when 5+ Contingency/Immediate Events called in capability period
   - Begins in first month when threshold reached

4. **Contract Terms**
   - 3-5 year duration
   - Fixed pricing throughout contract term
   - Provides revenue certainty vs annual tariff fluctuations

### Payment Calculation Example (Hypothetical)

*Note: Using CSRP baseline for illustration since actual Term-DLM bid prices not disclosed*

**Scenario:** 1 MW Term-DLM resource, 5-month season, 4 events called, 4 hours each

- Capacity Payment: 1,000 kW × $15/kW-month × 5 months = $75,000
- Performance Payment: 1,000 kW × 4 hrs × 4 events × $1/kWh = $16,000
- **Total Season Revenue: $91,000**

If 5+ events called:
- Bonus kicks in: +$5/kW-month starting month 5
- Additional: 1,000 kW × $5/kW-month × 1 month = $5,000

## Strategic Value for Battery Energy Storage

### Why These Programs Matter for BESS

1. **Multi-Year Revenue Certainty**
   - 3-5 year contracts enable project financing
   - Fixed pricing throughout contract term
   - Reduces annual pricing risk vs CSRP

2. **Dual Revenue Stacking**
   - Term-DLM for day-ahead optimization (energy arbitrage + DR)
   - Auto-DLM for premium rapid-response revenue
   - Both can stack with NYISO wholesale market participation

3. **Perfect BESS Fit**
   - Fast response capability (10 minutes) = Auto-DLM premium
   - 4-hour duration matches typical BESS specifications
   - No fuel restrictions (unlike diesel generators)
   - Can provide 100% reliable response (vs load curtailment uncertainty)

4. **Network-Specific Targeting**
   - Tier 2 networks offer higher value
   - Can site BESS in highest-value networks
   - Network congestion = higher wholesale prices too (double benefit)

5. **Competitive Advantage in Bidding**
   - BESS can bid lower $/kW (confident in performance)
   - Higher performance ratio = competitive edge in future procurements
   - Aggregators (like CPower) actively seeking BESS resources

### Optimization Strategy for BESS

**Term-DLM Strategy:**
- Use day-ahead price forecasts to optimize energy arbitrage
- Ensure adequate SOC for 4-hour call window
- Stack with NYISO day-ahead market participation
- Target networks with highest Tier 2 value

**Auto-DLM Strategy:**
- Maintain SOC buffer for rapid deployment
- Premium justifies opportunity cost of held capacity
- True contingency reserve = rare calls = high $/kW value
- Can still perform energy arbitrage outside 6 AM-midnight window

## Recommendations for BESS Developers

1. **Prioritize Auto-DLM if possible**
   - Premium payment for rapid-response capability
   - Perfect match for BESS technical specifications
   - Less competition (only 4 participants in 2024)
   - Wider availability window (18 hrs/day vs 4 hrs/day)

2. **Site selection strategy**
   - Target Tier 2 networks for higher value
   - Check network call window alignment with peak pricing
   - Consider networks with frequent congestion (dual benefit)

3. **Competitive bidding strategy**
   - BESS can bid more aggressively (higher performance certainty)
   - Use CSRP rates ($6-18/kW-month) + DLRP rates ($18-25/kW-month) as benchmarks
   - Auto-DLM should justify premium above CSRP+DLRP combined
   - Term-DLM bid at/near CSRP equivalence

4. **Revenue stacking optimization**
   - Layer with NYISO wholesale market participation
   - Consider VDER (Value of Distributed Energy Resources) value stacking
   - Optimize SOC management across all revenue streams
   - Model opportunity cost of held capacity for Auto-DLM

5. **Contract terms**
   - 5-year contracts maximize financing certainty
   - Ensure contract allows for wholesale market participation
   - Verify penalty structure acceptable before bidding

6. **Partnership approach**
   - Consider partnering with established aggregators (CPower, etc.)
   - Aggregators have existing Con Edison relationships
   - May handle bidding, nomination, event response complexity

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Long-term contracts (3-5 years) are the game-changer** - Fixed pricing enables project financing and eliminates annual tariff risk

2. **Two programs, two use cases** - Term-DLM for day-ahead optimization, Auto-DLM for premium rapid-response revenue

3. **Performance speaks volumes** - 2024 results show Term-DLM at 158% and Auto-DLM at 112% vs CSRP at 70%, validating multi-year contract approach

4. **BESS is the perfect fit** - Fast response, high reliability, 4-hour duration, no fuel restrictions = competitive advantage in bidding

5. **Competitive procurement protects ratepayers** - Pay-as-bid ensures efficient pricing, but also means rates not publicly disclosed

6. **Data gaps exist** - Event limits, penalty structures, and actual clearing prices not available in public documentation

**Overall Assessment:** These are high-value, well-structured programs specifically designed to drive energy storage deployment. Strong fit for BESS projects seeking long-term revenue certainty in the New York market.
