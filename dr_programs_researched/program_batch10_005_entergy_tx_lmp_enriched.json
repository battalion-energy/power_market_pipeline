  "research_notes": "CRITICAL FINDINGS:\n\n1. ISO TERRITORY CLARIFICATION: Entergy Texas operates in MISO South, NOT ERCOT. This is confirmed through multiple sources. Entergy Texas joined MISO in December 2013. Service area is Southeast Texas only (27 counties, 524k customers).\n\n2. DUAL PROGRAM STRUCTURE: There are TWO distinct types of DR programs potentially available:\n   a) MISO wholesale DR programs (LMR Type I/II, DRR) - CONFIRMED ACTIVE, well-documented, strong economics\n   b) Entergy Texas retail utility load management program - EXISTENCE UNCONFIRMED\n\n3. PROGRAM VERIFICATION FAILURE: Despite extensive research, the specific retail utility load management program referenced in original URL could not be verified:\n   - Original URL returns 404 error\n   - Alternative URLs return 403 forbidden\n   - MVDR and IS tariff riders exist but PDFs not readable\n   - No publicly accessible information confirms program details\n   - Previous Batch 2 research also failed to verify program existence\n\n4. TARIFF RIDERS EXIST: Entergy Texas DOES have demand response tariff riders on file:\n   - MVDR (Market Valued Demand Response Rider)\n   - IS (Interruptible Service Rider)\n   - These suggest some form of DR program exists, but details not accessible\n\n5. ENERGY EFFICIENCY VS DEMAND RESPONSE: Entergy Texas Commercial Solutions program offers equipment-based incentives (lighting, HVAC, refrigeration) but these are efficiency upgrades, NOT operational load curtailment/demand response programs.\n\n6. STRONG ALTERNATIVE AVAILABLE: MISO wholesale DR programs are well-documented and offer strong economics for batteries ($666.50/MW-day summer 2025 capacity payments). These are confirmed active and suitable for battery participation.\n\n7. DATA QUALITY: This research receives low data quality score because retail program existence cannot be confirmed. However, MISO wholesale programs are well-documented (see program_batch9_006).",
