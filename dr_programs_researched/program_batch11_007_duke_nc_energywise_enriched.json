    "suitability_rating": "LOW (1/10)",
    "reason": "EnergyWise Business is designed as an HVAC-focused demand response program for small to mid-size commercial customers. Program structure centers on smart thermostat installation (Summer) or manual/signaled load curtailment (Winter) for air conditioning and heating equipment. While Winter Option theoretically allows equipment connection to Duke's control system, there is no documentation, precedent, or technical guidance for battery participation. The utility-controlled or signal-based model conflicts with typical battery optimization strategies requiring precise SOC management, charging schedules, and arbitrage opportunities.",

        "DO NOT enroll in EnergyWise Business - program not designed for batteries",
        "INSTEAD: Enroll in PowerShare Non-Residential Load Curtailment ($5/kW, customer-controlled)",
        "Focus on behind-the-meter peak shaving and time-of-use arbitrage as primary revenue streams",

      "for_hvac_focused_businesses": [
        "EnergyWise Business is EXCELLENT program for small commercial facilities with HVAC loads",
        "Free smart thermostat upgrade + $50/kW incentive provides strong value for AC-heavy operations",
        "Both summer and winter options available depending on facility needs",
        "2-event opt-out provision and 40-hour seasonal cap provide reasonable customer flexibility"

    "comparison_summary": {
      "vs_onsite_generation": "Completely different program types - On-Site was inactive generator program, EnergyWise is active HVAC demand response",
      "vs_powershare": "PowerShare is superior for large C&I customers and battery systems due to customer control and technology flexibility. EnergyWise better for smaller customers with HVAC-focused demand response needs."
