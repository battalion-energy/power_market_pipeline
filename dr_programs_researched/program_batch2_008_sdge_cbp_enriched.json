  "description": "The Capacity Bidding Program (CBP) is a CPUC-authorized demand response program operated by San Diego Gas & Electric (SDGE) that compensates commercial, industrial, and agricultural customers for committing to reduce electricity consumption during grid emergencies or high-demand periods. The program provides monthly capacity payments for enrollment commitment plus energy payments for actual curtailment performance during events. Participants can enroll directly with SDGE or through third-party aggregators. The program operates May through October with events called weekdays from 11 AM to 7 PM, with day-ahead or day-of notification options and multiple product duration choices.",

SDGE CBP webpage confirmed program seasons (May-October), eligibility (commercial/industrial/agricultural), call windows (11 AM - 7 PM weekdays), and approved aggregators (Voltus, Enel X). Key limitation: Schedule CBP tariff PDF containing current 2024-2025 capacity payment rates could not be accessed. Historical rates from E-4020 show May capacity payments ranging $5.37-$6.79/kW-month depending on product (Day-Ahead vs Day-Of, duration 1-4 hr vs 4-8 hr), with higher rates in peak summer months. Program has unique Day-Of notification option not offered by other California IOUs. Energy payments are natural gas price-based with 15,000 BTU/kWh heat rate trigger. Performance structure includes tiered penalties: 100% performance = full payment, 90-99% = proportional, 75-89% = 50% payment, 50-74% = no payment/no penalty, <50% = financial penalties. Maximum 24 event hours per month. Program authorized through 2027 by CPUC.

    "battery_optimization_notes": "Good candidate program for battery energy storage systems (BESS) in SDGE territory. Key advantages: (1) Predictable call windows (11 AM - 7 PM weekdays) align with typical battery arbitrage opportunities during peak hours, (2) May-October season avoids winter months when battery performance may be impacted, (3) Multiple duration products allow optimization based on battery capacity and discharge capabilities, (4) Day-Of notification option provides flexibility for same-day arbitrage decisions, (5) Over-performance incentives up to 150% of nomination reward larger battery systems, (6) Monthly capacity payments provide guaranteed revenue stream independent of event calls, (7) 24-hour monthly event limit is modest allowing revenue stacking with other programs/arbitrage, (8) Performance below 75% still receives partial/no payment without penalty allowing conservative nominations. Key considerations: (1) Need to model impact of CBP commitments on daily arbitrage revenue during May-October, (2) Day-Ahead vs Day-Of product selection impacts capacity payment rate and operational flexibility, (3) Duration product selection (1-4 hr vs 4-8 hr) must align with battery discharge capability and round-trip efficiency, (4) Baseline calculation methodology critical for accurate performance measurement, (5) Integration with CAISO wholesale markets and other DR programs requires careful coordination. Recommended approach: Enroll through aggregator (Voltus or Enel X) for turnkey management, select Day-Of 2-6 hour product for flexibility, nominate conservative capacity (50-70% of battery capacity) to ensure performance, stack with other revenue sources during non-event periods.",
    "notes": "SDGE CBP is well-structured program with clear performance tiers, multiple product options, and two-part payment structure (capacity + energy). Program design balances utility need for reliable demand response with participant flexibility through duration and notification options. Historical baseline rates from CPUC resolution provide useful benchmarks but current rates likely differ. The Day-Of option unique to SDGE provides valuable flexibility not available in PG&E or SCE CBP programs. Maximum 24 hours per month is relatively low compared to other DR programs, suggesting SDGE uses CBP for reliability events rather than economic dispatch. Natural gas-based energy payment methodology links compensation to wholesale market conditions. Overall good program for battery optimization given predictable parameters, over-performance incentives, and revenue stacking potential."
