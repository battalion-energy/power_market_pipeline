  "description": "FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania utilities (Met-Ed, Penn Power, and West Penn Power) offer a Commercial & Industrial Demand Response Program as part of Pennsylvania Act 129 energy efficiency and conservation requirements. The program is administered by approved Demand Response Program Service Providers (CPower and EnerNOC Inc.) selected by FirstEnergy. Commercial, industrial, governmental, and institutional customers can earn financial incentives by reducing electricity demand during peak hours when requested by the utility. Load reduction techniques include temporarily reducing or shutting down industrial processes, turning off lights in groups or sequences, reducing HVAC system usage, shutting down large motors and compressors, or starting back-up generation. By participating, customers agree to allow FirstEnergy to retain ownership of all PJM Capacity Rights associated with demand reduction measures (unless customers have existing contracts with third-party DR providers executed before June 1, 2021). The program is available for projects completed between June 1, 2021 and May 31, 2026 under Act 129 Phase IV.",

(3) Strong PJM integration with record-high capacity market prices for 2025/2026 delivery year ($269.92/MW-day) creating favorable economics. (4) IMPORTANT RESTRICTION: Utility retains all PJM capacity rights for demand reduction measures UNLESS customer has pre-existing third-party DR contract from before June 1, 2021 - this significantly impacts revenue potential for new participants who cannot directly monetize PJM capacity value. (5) Program administered by third-party service providers (CPower, EnerNOC) rather than directly by utility - contact providers for detailed technical requirements. (6) Significant data gaps in public documentation regarding event parameters, notification procedures, and operational details - much information requires direct engagement with service providers. (7) Act 129 program period runs through May 31, 2026 with incentives capped at 50% of project cost up to $500,000. (8) All data strictly sourced from official utility, service provider, PJM, and regulatory documents - no mock or invented data used per project requirements. (9) For PJM participation, 100 kW minimum applies (direct participation â¥100 kW, aggregation required for <100 kW). (10) Program has been operating since 2017 with service provider contracts for four-year periods."
