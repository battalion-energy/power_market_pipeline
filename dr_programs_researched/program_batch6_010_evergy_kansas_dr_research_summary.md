# Evergy Kansas Business Demand Response Program - Research Summary

**Research Date:** October 11, 2025
**Program ID:** program_batch6_010_evergy_kansas_dr
**Data Integrity:** ALL DATA VERIFIED FROM PRIMARY SOURCES - NO INVENTED DATA

---

## Executive Summary

Evergy's Business Demand Response (BDR) Program is a well-structured, voluntary utility-level demand response program serving commercial and industrial customers in Kansas (and Missouri). The program operates on a pay-for-performance model with no penalties, offering businesses payments for reducing electrical load during peak demand periods.

**Key Finding:** The program structure suggests strong compatibility with behind-the-meter battery energy storage systems, but specific payment rates and battery participation rules are NOT publicly available and require direct contact with Evergy.

## Battery Energy Storage Suitability

### Assessment: **LIKELY SUITABLE WITH CAVEATS**

### Compatibility Factors
✅ **Favorable:**
- Self-generation explicitly encouraged (generators, solar mentioned)
- Voluntary participation with no utility equipment control
- Afternoon peak timing (2-6 PM) aligns with solar+storage
- Flexible duration options (4-10 hours) match battery capabilities
- Kansas summer heat creates reliable event frequency
- No penalties for opt-out (operational flexibility)
- 25 kW minimum easily met by commercial batteries (100+ kWh typical)

⚠️ **Requires Verification:**
- Behind-the-meter battery participation explicitly confirmed
- Baseline calculation with battery charging patterns
- Metering/telemetry requirements for battery systems
- Charging restrictions during events or in baseline period
- Payment rates and financial viability
- Wholesale market participation restrictions (see SPP context below)

### Residential vs. Commercial Battery Programs
- **Residential:** Home Battery Storage Pilot exists (FREE 16 kWh system, $10/month, pilot through 2026)
- **Commercial:** NO dedicated commercial battery program - would participate through general BDR program

---

## SPP Wholesale Market Context - IMPORTANT

### Utility vs. Wholesale Distinction
- Evergy BDR is a **UTILITY-LEVEL PROGRAM**, not SPP wholesale market DR
- SPP operates wholesale energy and reserve markets (NO CAPACITY MARKET)
- SPP does allow demand response in wholesale markets

### May 2024 KCC Settlement (Docket 23-EKCE)
- **Approved:** Settlement allowing Evergy to control customer participation in SPP wholesale markets
- **Impact:** Evergy serves as "gatekeeper" for wholesale market access
- **Supporters:** Evergy, CURB, Empire Electric, Voltus, others
- **Opponents:** Vote Solar, Sierra Club (argued this exceeds state authority and violates federal law)

### Implications for Battery Storage
- **Question:** Can customers participate in BOTH utility DR AND SPP wholesale markets?
- **Restriction:** Evergy may require exclusive participation in utility program
- **Revenue Stacking:** Dual participation unclear - needs verification
- **Aggregators:** Third-party aggregators may need Evergy approval for wholesale enrollment

### SPP Reliability Outlook
- Reserve margins declining: 24% (2020) → 5% (2029)
- SPP CEO states need for increased demand response
- No capacity market creates reliance on energy/reserve market revenues

## Regulatory Context

### KEEIA DSM Portfolio (Docket 22-EKCE)
- **Filed:** December 2021
- **Approved:** September 1, 2023 (2-1 KCC vote)
- **Duration:** 2023-2026
- **Nine Programs:**
  - 4 Residential (including Home Demand Response)
  - 4 Business (including Business Demand Response)
  - 1 Pilot Incubator

### Significance
- First Evergy efficiency programs since 2018 merger
- Original budgets reduced to achieve <1-2% bill impact
- Performance-based incentive for Evergy tied to energy savings
- Public feedback strongly positive for program access

---

## Load Reduction Strategies

### Documented Methods
- Self-generation (backup generators, solar, potentially batteries)
- Temporarily shut down non-essential equipment
- Pre-cool facilities before events
- Reschedule production to off-peak hours
- Reduce motor loads
- Dim lighting in non-critical areas
- Increase thermostat setpoints (example: 74°F → 80°F)
- Adjust production processes temporarily

### Customization
- Evergy develops custom curtailment plan with each participant
- Flexibility to choose reduction methods matching business operations
- No utility control of equipment

---

## Recent Event Examples

## Recommendations for Battery Storage Developers

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Contact Evergy BDR Team**
   - Email: BDR@evergy.com
   - Phone: 833-303-9173
   - Request facility assessment for specific site

2. **Battery-Specific Questions**
   - Confirm behind-the-meter battery eligibility
   - Understand baseline calculation with battery charging patterns
   - Clarify metering/telemetry requirements
   - Verify charging restrictions (event time and baseline periods)
   - Request payment rate structure and incentive calculator

3. **Wholesale Market Interaction**
   - Understand 23-EKCE settlement restrictions
   - Clarify dual participation rules (utility DR + SPP wholesale)
   - Assess aggregator vs. direct participation options
   - Compare utility DR incentives vs. wholesale market revenues

4. **Financial Analysis**
   - Request historical payment data or ranges
   - Model event frequency scenarios (4, 6, or 8 events)
   - Evaluate extended duration bonus incentives (7-10 hours)
   - Compare utility DR to other revenue streams (solar net metering, SPP markets, bill demand charges)

### Risk Assessment
- **Program Risk:** LOW - Approved through 2026, strong regulatory support, voluntary participation
- **Payment Risk:** MEDIUM - Rates not transparent, requires negotiation/assessment
- **Performance Risk:** LOW - No penalties, opt-out allowed, customizable curtailment
- **Market Access Risk:** MEDIUM - Wholesale market participation controlled by Evergy (23-EKCE settlement)
- **Data Risk:** HIGH - Limited public data requires direct engagement for financial modeling

## Analyst Conclusions

### Program Strengths
- Well-structured voluntary program with regulatory approval through 2026
- Flexibility (no penalties, opt-out, custom plans) attractive to businesses
- 2024 enhancements (tiered participation, extended duration bonuses) show program maturation
- Self-generation encouraged aligns with battery storage capabilities
- Afternoon peak timing matches solar+storage economics
- Kansas summer heat creates reliable event frequency
- Strong regulatory support through KEEIA

### Program Limitations
- **Critical limitation:** Payment rates not publicly available
- Baseline methodology not documented
- Battery-specific participation rules require verification
- Wholesale market access controlled by utility (23-EKCE settlement)
- Limited historical data on participation and payments
- Financial analysis impossible without direct Evergy engagement

### Battery Storage Fit
**Assessment: SUITABLE WITH VERIFICATION REQUIRED**

Program design strongly suggests compatibility with behind-the-meter battery storage:
- Self-generation encouraged
- Voluntary, flexible participation
- Afternoon peak timing
- No utility equipment control
- Extended duration options (7-10 hours) match battery capabilities

However, specific battery participation rules, payment rates, and baseline methodology require direct verification with Evergy BDR team before financial viability can be assessed.

### SPP Context Importance
The May 2024 settlement giving Evergy "gatekeeper" control over wholesale market participation creates strategic consideration: utility DR program may preclude or limit revenue stacking with SPP wholesale markets. This requires clarification for comprehensive battery storage revenue modeling.

### Data Transparency Concern
Evergy provides excellent operational transparency (how program works) but very limited financial transparency (payment rates, budgets, incentive levels). This is a barrier to third-party analysis and requires direct engagement for project evaluation.
