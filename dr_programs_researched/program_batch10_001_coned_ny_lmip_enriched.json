  "description": "CRITICAL FINDING: The 'Load Management Incentive Program' does NOT exist as a standalone program at Con Edison. As of October 2025, the URL provided (https://www.coned.com/en/.../load-management-incentive-program) returns a 404 error page. This program name was previously researched in Batch 3 (program_batch3_001_coned_lmip_enriched.json) where it was found to redirect to the Commercial & Industrial Energy Efficiency Program (equipment rebates). The URL now no longer exists. Con Edison's actual demand response programs with ongoing payments are: (1) Commercial System Relief Program (CSRP) - researched in Batch 8, (2) Distribution Load Relief Program (DLRP) - researched in Batch 2, (3) Long Term Dynamic Load Management (TERM-DLM), and (4) Automatic Dynamic Load Management (AUTO-DLM). All of these are part of the 'Smart Usage Rewards' portfolio. There is NO separate 'Load Management Incentive Program' offering demand response payments. Historical records show Con Edison offered thermal storage incentives through 2016 ($2,600/kW) but this was discontinued. The source data listing this as a program appears to be outdated or incorrect.",
