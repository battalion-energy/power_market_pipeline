  "description": "The Central Hudson Targeted Demand Response (TDR) program is exclusively offered to commercial and industrial customers located in specific energy-constrained areas. The program uses demand response as an alternative to traditional growth-related infrastructure investments within targeted areas of Central Hudson's service territory, a strategy known as a 'non-wires alternative'. Participants commit to reduce their electricity usage at critical times during the summer season and receive monthly capacity payments.",
