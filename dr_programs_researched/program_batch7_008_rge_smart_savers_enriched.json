CRITICAL FINDING: RG&E Smart Savings Rewards is IDENTICAL to NYSEG Smart Savings Rewards - same enrollment platform (thermostatrewards.com), same payment structure ($70 enrollment + $20 seasonal), same event parameters (May-Sept, 1-7 PM, max 15 events, 4-degree adjustment), same eligible devices. This is an Avangrid-standardized program deployed across both utilities. The only differences are service territory (RG&E serves Rochester/9-county region in NYISO Zone B; NYSEG serves central/eastern NY) and utility branding. Battery storage alternatives comprehensively documented since primary program is thermostat-only and unsuitable for BESS optimization. RG&E battery customers should pursue Energy Storage Solutions Program ($50/kW), CSRP ($4.25-4.50/kW-month + $0.50/kWh), NYSERDA incentives ($175-400/kWh), and VDER Value Stack."
