  "research_notes": "DUPLICATE ENTRY CONFIRMATION: This is the same MISO demand response program researched in Batch 5 (index 54). Minnesota is in MISO Zone 1 (LRZ 1), not Zone 4. The user request incorrectly referenced 'Zone 4' which primarily covers Illinois. All program details are identical to Batch 5 research. PRIMARY UPDATE: 2025 Planning Resource Auction results show dramatic capacity price increases for Zone 1, with summer prices jumping from $30/MW-day (2024) to $666.50/MW-day (2025), representing a 2,122% increase. This makes battery storage significantly more attractive in Minnesota for the 2025/26 planning year. Annual capacity revenue potential increased from ~$21,900/MW to ~$77,738/MW. The tightening capacity situation (reduced surplus from 4.6 GW to 2.6 GW) is driving market fundamentals. For comprehensive program rules, eligibility requirements, baseline methodology, and operational details, refer to the original Batch 5 research file program_batch5_008_miso_minnesota_enriched.json.",

  "research_quality_notes": "Score of 9 (high quality) because: (1) Confirmed this is duplicate of comprehensive Batch 5 research, (2) Successfully obtained current 2025 PRA pricing data from official MISO sources, (3) Clarified zone assignment error (Minnesota is Zone 1, not Zone 4), (4) Calculated updated revenue potential for battery storage, (5) All pricing data verified from primary sources (MISO PRA results PDF). Deducted 1 point because website navigation failed (404 errors) requiring reliance on web search for current pricing instead of direct MISO portal access."
