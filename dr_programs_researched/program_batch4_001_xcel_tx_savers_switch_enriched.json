  "description": "Xcel Energy's Saver's Switch program in Texas helps manage peak electricity demand by remotely cycling central air conditioning units and electric water heaters during high-demand periods. The program operates through Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS) in the Texas Panhandle region. Participants receive annual credits for allowing remote control of their AC units during peak demand events, which typically occur on hot summer days between 2 PM and 7 PM. The program uses a remote switch that cycles AC units on and off for 15-20 minute intervals, while the fan continues to circulate air.",
