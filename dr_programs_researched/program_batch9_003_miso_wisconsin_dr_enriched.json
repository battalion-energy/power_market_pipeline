  "research_notes": "IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION: Wisconsin is in Local Resource Zone 2 (LRZ 2), NOT Zone 5. Zone 5 is Missouri. LRZ 2 comprises most of Wisconsin and a small portion of Michigan. Wisconsin experienced the same capacity price increases as other MISO zones in 2025/26: summer prices jumped from 30 to 666.50 $/MW-day (2100% increase) due to MISO's new Reliability-Based Demand Curve (RBDC) and 3.3 GW of capacity retirements. MISO is undergoing significant DR program reforms: EDR elimination by 2026/27 (never used), LMR accreditation changes by 2028/29 (two-tier notification system), and enforcement actions against non-performing resources. Battery storage can participate as behind-the-meter non-injecting resources through LMR (capacity-focused) or DRR (energy market participation). The combination of record-high capacity prices, multiple participation pathways, and battery-compatible technical requirements makes this an exceptionally attractive program for BESS, despite ongoing regulatory changes. Key strategic insight: LMR Type II (30-min notification) aligns perfectly with battery response capabilities while earning 100% capacity credit if response time is under 2 hours. DRR provides additional energy market revenue opportunities with must-offer obligations.",

  "research_quality_score": 9,
  "research_quality_notes": "High-quality research with verified data from official MISO auction results, business practices manuals, FERC filings, and stakeholder presentations. Capacity prices confirmed from primary sources (MISO PRA results). Program requirements documented from BPM-026 manual. Regulatory changes tracked through RASC proceedings and FERC filings. Only minor gaps: specific event duration requirements not documented, and some DRR technical details require direct access to password-protected MISO portals. Zone clarification critical: Wisconsin is LRZ 2, not Zone 5."
