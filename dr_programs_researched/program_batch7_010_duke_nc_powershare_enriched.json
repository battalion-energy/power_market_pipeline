Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress in NC are NOT in PJM. Only Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky participate in PJM. A small Dominion-served area in northeastern NC participates in PJM, but Duke's Carolinas territories do not.",

  "final_determination": {
    "suitable_for_battery_optimization": true,
    "suitability_level": "MODERATE - Better than no DR, but severely limited vs RTO/ISO markets",
    "reason": "PowerShare allows commercial battery participation through load curtailment mechanism. Batteries can discharge during events to reduce grid load and earn $5/kW capacity payments. However, lack of organized wholesale markets (no PJM access despite user assumption) severely limits revenue stacking potential compared to RTO/ISO territories.",
