    "justification": "This is a utility-administered aggregation of PJM wholesale demand response programs (primarily Emergency Load Response Program). Battery storage is eligible to participate in PJM demand response programs, though PJM has historically created barriers for BESS using Surplus Interconnection Service. PJM capacity accreditation for BESS is 57-78% of installed capacity depending on discharge duration. Good rating because: 1) PJM capacity prices are at record highs ($269-329/MW-day for 2025-2027), making participation financially attractive, 2) BESS can provide precise, predictable curtailment responses, 3) Summer-focused program aligns with battery arbitrage opportunities, 4) Can potentially stack with wholesale market participation. Limited by: 1) Lack of public information on exact payment rates through FirstEnergy aggregation, 2) Must work through third-party aggregators (CPower/EnerNOC), 3) PJM interconnection barriers for BESS, 4) Minimum load requirements unknown."

  "research_notes": "This program is a utility-administered aggregation service that enables FirstEnergy Pennsylvania customers to participate in PJM wholesale demand response markets (primarily Emergency Load Response Program). The utility contracts with CPower and EnerNOC as approved aggregators. Key limitations: 1) No specific payment rates publicly available - must contact aggregators directly, 2) No event notification or duration specifications on public website, 3) No minimum load requirements published, 4) Program details administered by third-party aggregators rather than utility directly. PJM context: Capacity prices have increased dramatically (833% increase from 2024/2025 to 2025/2026), making demand response highly lucrative. However, PJM has historically created barriers for BESS participation through Surplus Interconnection Service restrictions. Battery operators should contact CPower/EnerNOC directly to determine: actual payment rates, event parameters, minimum load requirements, whether additional PJM program participation is allowed, and specific battery storage eligibility requirements. Act 129 requires Pennsylvania utilities to implement demand response programs, and FirstEnergy fulfills this requirement through this aggregation service.",
