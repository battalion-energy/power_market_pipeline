  "description": "Con Edison's Term-DLM and Auto-DLM are long-term contract-based demand response programs established by the New York Public Service Commission in September 2020. Term-DLM is a day-ahead peak-shaving program requiring 21 hours advance notice, while Auto-DLM is a rapid-response program requiring only 10 minutes advance notice. Both programs offer 3-5 year contracts providing longer-term price certainty compared to tariff-based programs like CSRP. These programs were designed to drive investment in energy storage and other long-term demand response resources by providing multi-year revenue commitments.",
