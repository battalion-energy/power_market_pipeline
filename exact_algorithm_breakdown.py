1. ENERGY BID AWARDS MISUNDERSTANDING:

   - Negative values = buying energy (load)
   
2. WE'RE MISSING THE OFFER CURVES:
   - DAM has OFFER curves (gen willing to sell)
   - DAM has BID curves (load willing to buy)
   - BESS submits BOTH:
     * Offer curve: "I'll discharge X MW at $Y"
     * Bid curve: "I'll charge X MW at $Y"
   
3. SETTLEMENT POINT CONFUSION:
   - Gen Resource has offers at settlement point
   - Load Resource has bids at SAME settlement point
   - Energy Bid Awards shows NET position at settlement point
   
4. DOUBLE COUNTING RISK:

CORRECT DAM REVENUE CALCULATION:

METHOD 1: Using Resource-Specific Awards
=========================================
1. DISCHARGE (Gen Resource):
   - Source: DAM_Gen_Resources
   - Filter: ResourceName == '{BESS_NAME}'
   - Revenue = Î£(AwardedQuantity Ã— SettlementPointPrice)

2. CHARGING (Load Resource):
   - Source: DAM_Load_Resources (if it has energy awards)
   - OR: Look for NEGATIVE awards in consolidated data
   - Cost = Î£(ChargingMW Ã— SettlementPointPrice)

METHOD 2: Using Energy Bid Awards (Net Position)
================================================
1. For each settlement point:
   - Positive EnergyBidAwardMW = Net selling (discharge > charge)
   - Negative EnergyBidAwardMW = Net buying (charge > discharge)
   - But this is NET, not gross!

THE KEY INSIGHT:
================
Energy Bid Awards shows NET position, not individual charge/discharge!
If BESS offers 100MW discharge and bids 80MW charge in same hour:
  - Energy Bid Award = +20MW (net discharge)
  - But actual flows: 100MW out, 80MW in (impossible physically!)

WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING:
========================
BESS can't charge and discharge simultaneously!
The awards should show:
  - Hours with positive awards = discharge only
  - Hours with negative awards = charge only
  - Never both in same hour

THE REAL PROBLEM:
=================
We're treating Energy Bid Awards as pure charging data, but it's actually
the NET cleared position at the settlement point!

CORRECT APPROACH:
=================

1. For DISCHARGE Revenue:
   - Use DAM_Gen_Resources -> AwardedQuantity
   - This is correct and working
   
2. For CHARGING Cost:
   OPTION A: Infer from Energy Bid Awards
   - When EnergyBidAwardMW < 0: Battery is net buyer (charging)
   - When EnergyBidAwardMW > 0: Battery is net seller (discharging)
   - BUT: Don't double count with DAM Gen Awards!
   
   OPTION B: Infer from dispatch pattern
   - Use state-of-charge logic
   - If battery discharged X MWh, it must have charged ~X/0.85 MWh
   - Find hours with lowest prices for charging
   
   OPTION C: Look for Load Resource awards
   - Check if there's a paired Load Resource
   - Use its awards for charging

3. AVOIDING DOUBLE COUNTING:
   - If using Energy Bid Awards, DON'T also use DAM Gen Awards
   - They might represent the same dispatch!

4. PRICE APPLICATION:
   - Use settlement point specific prices when available
   - Otherwise use hub average (HB_BUSAVG)
   - Make sure to match hour-by-hour

IMMEDIATE FIX:
==============
1. Check if Energy Bid Awards positive values overlap with DAM Gen Awards
2. If yes, we're double counting - use only one source
3. Verify charging MWh is reasonable (should be ~1.2x discharge MWh)
4. Recalculate with proper algorithm
