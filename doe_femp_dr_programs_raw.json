The program is offered through CPower and allows customers to earn revenue for being available to curtail load on short notice when the grid is stressed. The program has two categories: APS Peak Solutions Day Of and APS Peak Solutions Day Ahead. For the Day Of program, APS provides 60 minutes notice prior to an interruption. The program runs from June 1 \u2013 September 30, and events can be called anytime between 4 and 9 P.M. Events last anywhere from 1-5 hours on a maximum of three consecutive days. Capacity and energy payments of $40 per kW and $0.09 per kWh, respectively, are paid to customers for reducing their energy consumption. There are no penalties for failing to respond to called events. The main differences between the two program categories is that for the Day Ahead program, customers receive notifications by 12pm (noon) the day before the event, and are compensated $32 per kW capacity instead of $40 per kW. CPower helps with registration and offers onsite facility assessments of curtailment oppoortiunities.",

MISO uses its markets to ensure resource adequacy and reliability in the region; DR participants are compensated when they deliver a promised reduction in load or use of onsite generation that is less costly than the next increment of supply at that node.

These arrangements are bids, not \"programs\" in the traditional sense of providing incentives or bill credits for moderating or shifting loads; MISO (and some other ISOs/RTOs) operate markets where demand flexibility can reap revenue when those resources (e.g., storage, curtailment, demand shifted away from peak demand hours) can compete economically as generators or reductions in demand. MISO uses its markets to ensure resource adequacy and reliability in the region; DR participants are compensated when they deliver a promised reduction in load or use of onsite generation that is less costly than the next increment of supply at that node. Interested businesses can get acquainted with MISO's demand response markets through a recent workshop (https://cdn.misoenergy.org/20240510%20Demand%20Response%20101%20Workshop%20Presentation632828.pdf) and can register their rsources to participate in the markets via a MISO DR tool (https://cdn.misoenergy.org/Demand%20Response%20Tool%20User%20Guide177286.pdf).",

The duration of unscheduled interruptions is based on the option chosen by the customer.

Interruptions during this period take place on weekdays from 1 to 7 P.M. starting on June 1st and ending September 30th. Incentives depend on the unscheduled interruptions option chosen and are based on verified demand savings that occur as a result of interruptions. During the winter period, customers must be able to reduce electric demand by at least 100 kW. Events may be called at any time of day or week during the program operating period from December 1st through February 28th.",
