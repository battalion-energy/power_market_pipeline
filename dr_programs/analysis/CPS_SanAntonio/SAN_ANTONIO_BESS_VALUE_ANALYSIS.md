**Project Scope:** 38 City of San Antonio buildings
**Technology:** Behind-the-meter Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)
**Objective:** Quantify complete value stack for strategic BESS deployment

---

## Executive Summary

The City of San Antonio has an opportunity to deploy BESS across 38 municipal buildings to capture multiple revenue streams and provide critical grid services. This analysis reveals that **optimally-sited BESS systems can generate $450-700/kW-year in combined value** - significantly higher than CPS Energy's demand response programs alone ($100-130/kW-year).

### Key Findings:

1. **CPS Energy DR programs are performance-based, NOT capacity payments** - revenue depends on event frequency
2. **Demand charge reduction is the largest guaranteed value stream** - $180-300/kW-year per building
3. **Infrastructure deferral can add $500-1,350/kW in one-time value** - annualized at $25-67/kW-year
4. **Strategic site selection is critical** - buildings on constrained feeders have 3-5x higher value
5. **Total value stack ranges from $1.76M-$2.75M/year** for 3.8 MW deployment across 38 buildings

- **Total:** **$6,630/year**
- **Effective Rate:** $66/kW-year

#### Typical Scenario (Historical Average)
- **Summer:** 23 events × 100 kW × ($73/kW ÷ 25) = **$6,716**
- **Winter:** 7 events × 100 kW × ($45/kW ÷ 10) = **$3,150**
- **Total:** **$9,866/year**
- **Effective Rate:** $99/kW-year

#### Maximum Scenario (All Events Called)
- **Summer:** 100 kW × $73/kW = **$7,300**
- **Bonus Hours:** 100 kW × $10/kW = **$1,000** (if eligible)
- **Winter:** 100 kW × $45/kW = **$4,500**
- **Total:** **$12,800/year**
- **Effective Rate:** $128/kW-year

**Expected Range:** **$66-128/kW-year** (average ~$100/kW-year)

## 2. ERCOT Real-Time Call Option Value (Your Existing Model)

### 2.1 Current Analysis

**Your Model:**
- **Call Option Value:** $8.5/kW-month ($102/kW-year)
- **Trigger:** ERCOT RT price > $50/MWh
- **Dispatch Duration:** 2 hours
- **Methodology:** BESS acts as synthetic call option for offtaker

**Assessment:** ✅ **Solid methodology and reasonable value estimate**

### 2.2 Alignment with CPS Energy DR Events

**Synergy Analysis:**
- CPS Energy DR events are triggered by **ERCOT emergency conditions**
- ERCOT emergencies correlate with **high RT prices (>$50/MWh)**
- **25-40 DR events/year aligns with ~30-50 high-price events historically**

**Value Stacking:**
- During DR events: Capture **both** DR payment AND RT price arbitrage
- Outside DR events: Capture RT price arbitrage independently
- **No conflict** - values are additive

**Combined Value Example (100 kW, single event):**
- CPS DR payment: ~$292/event (based on $73/kW ÷ 25 events)
- RT arbitrage: 2 hours × 100 kW × ($200/MWh - $30/MWh) = $34,000/event
- **Total event value:** ~$34,292

**Your $8.5/kW-month call option value captures this RT arbitrage component.**

## 3. Demand Charge Reduction - Largest Guaranteed Value

### 3.1 CPS Energy Commercial Demand Charges

**Typical San Antonio Commercial Rate Structure:**

| Component | Summer (Jun-Sept) | Winter (Oct-May) | Annual |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| **Demand Charge** | $18-25/kW-month | $10-15/kW-month | $180-300/kW-year |
| **Energy Charge** | $0.05-0.08/kWh | $0.04-0.06/kWh | Variable |
| **Fixed Charges** | ~$50-200/month | ~$50-200/month | $600-2,400/year |

**Source:** CPS Energy Schedule CLG, GS, MLP (varies by customer class)

### 3.2 Peak Demand Reduction Value

**For 100 kW BESS reducing building peak by 100 kW:**

**Annual Demand Charge Savings:**
- **Summer:** 4 months × 100 kW × $22/kW-month (avg) = $8,800
- **Winter:** 8 months × 100 kW × $12/kW-month (avg) = $9,600
- **Total:** **$18,400/year**
- **Effective Rate:** $184/kW-year

**Conservative Estimate:** $180/kW-year
**Aggressive Estimate:** $300/kW-year (high demand charge schedules)
**Typical:** $220-240/kW-year

### 3.3 Building-Specific Considerations

**To maximize demand charge reduction value:**

1. **Identify Peak Billing Demand:**
   - Request 12 months of interval data for each building
   - Identify monthly peak kW (15-minute intervals)
   - Determine coincidence with CPS Energy system peak

2. **Assess Peak Shaving Potential:**
   - Buildings with "peaky" loads (high peak-to-average ratio) = higher value
   - Buildings with consistent baseload = lower value
   - Target: 30-60% peak reduction without operational impact

3. **Rate Schedule Analysis:**
   - Different CPS Energy schedules have different demand charges
   - Large General Service (LGS): typically highest demand charges
   - Verify each building's current rate schedule

**Action Item:** Request demand charge analysis from CPS Energy for all 38 buildings

## 4. Transmission & Distribution Infrastructure Deferral Value

### 4.1 Industry-Standard Infrastructure Costs

#### Distribution-Level Infrastructure (Direct Deferral)

| Component | Typical Cost ($/kW) | Applicability to BESS |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Distribution Transformer** | $150-400/kW | Direct 1:1 deferral |
| **Distribution Lines/Cables** | $100-300/kW | Direct 1:1 deferral |
| **Distribution Substation** | $200-500/kW | Shared deferral (feeder-level) |
| **Switchgear/Protection** | $50-150/kW | Direct deferral |
| **TOTAL Distribution** | **$500-1,350/kW** | **Full deferral potential** |

**Sources:**
- EPRI: "Distribution System Cost Methodology" (2022)
- California IOU Cost Allocation Studies
- DOE: "Grid Modernization Initiative" cost benchmarks

#### Transmission-Level Infrastructure (Shared Deferral)

| Component | Typical Cost ($/kW) | BESS Impact |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Transmission Lines** | $300-600/kW | Shared benefit (substation service area) |
| **Transmission Substations** | $300-800/kW | Shared benefit (zone-level) |
| **Transmission Transformers** | $200-400/kW | Shared benefit |
| **TOTAL Transmission** | **$800-1,800/kW** | **Proportional deferral** |

### 4.2 Annualized Infrastructure Deferral Value

**Methodology:**

```
Annualized Value = (Total Deferred Cost) × (BESS kW / Total Feeder kW) × (Discount Rate / Equipment Life)
```

**Example Calculation:**

**Scenario:** Building on feeder requiring $2M transformer upgrade
- Feeder Capacity: 500 kW
- BESS Capacity: 100 kW
- Equipment Life: 20 years
- Discount Rate: 5%

**Calculation:**
```
Direct Deferral = $2M × (100 kW / 500 kW) = $400,000
Annualized (20yr, 5%) = $400,000 × 0.0802 = $32,080/year
Per-kW Rate = $32,080 / 100 kW = $321/kW-year
```

**Typical Annualized Values:**

| Scenario | Deferral Value ($/kW-year) |
|----------|----------------------------|
| **Low Impact** (unconstrained feeder) | $0-10/kW-year |
| **Moderate** (growing load, 10yr deferral) | $25-50/kW-year |
| **High Impact** (constrained, near-term upgrade) | $50-150/kW-year |
| **Critical** (immediate upgrade needed) | $150-400/kW-year |

**Fleet Average (38 buildings):** $25-67/kW-year

### 4.3 Methodology to Calculate Building-Specific Deferral Value

#### Step 1: Request Distribution System Data from CPS Energy

**Contact:** CPS Energy Grid Planning - 210-353-3333

**Data Request Template:**

```
Subject: Distribution System Analysis for City of San Antonio BESS Project

Dear CPS Energy Grid Planning,

The City of San Antonio is evaluating battery energy storage system (BESS)
deployment at 38 municipal buildings. To quantify the grid infrastructure
deferral value, we request the following information:

For each of our 38 buildings (addresses attached):

1. Distribution Feeder Information:
   - Feeder ID/name
   - Feeder peak load (kW) and capacity (kVA)
   - Current loading percentage (% of capacity)
   - Load growth projection (next 10 years)

2. Planned Infrastructure Upgrades:
   - Any planned transformer upgrades (timing, cost estimate)
   - Any planned feeder upgrades (timing, cost estimate)
   - Any planned substation upgrades affecting these buildings

3. System Constraint Analysis:
   - Which feeders are classified as "constrained" (>80% peak loading)
   - Reliability metrics (SAIDI/SAIFI) for each feeder
   - Any thermal or voltage constraint issues

4. Economic Valuation:
   - CPS Energy's marginal cost of distribution capacity ($/kW)
   - Value of peak demand reduction ($/kW-year)
   - Locational value factors (if any)

This information will help us optimize BESS deployment to provide maximum
grid benefit while reducing City facilities' electricity costs.

Please let us know if you need additional information or would like to
schedule a meeting to discuss this analysis.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
City of San Antonio
```

#### Step 2: Analyze Constrained Circuits

**For each building, determine:**

1. **Feeder Loading:** Current peak % of capacity
   - **Priority 1:** Feeders >90% loaded (immediate constraint)
   - **Priority 2:** Feeders 80-90% loaded (near-term constraint)
   - **Priority 3:** Feeders 70-80% loaded (medium-term constraint)
   - **Priority 4:** Feeders <70% loaded (unconstrained)

2. **Planned Upgrade Timeline:**
   - **High Value:** Upgrade planned within 3 years
   - **Medium Value:** Upgrade planned 3-7 years
   - **Low Value:** Upgrade planned 7+ years or no plans

3. **Upgrade Cost Allocation:**
   - Determine BESS's proportional impact on deferral
   - Account for other load growth factors
   - Conservative approach: 30-50% deferral attribution to BESS

#### Step 3: Calculate Site-Specific NPV

**For each priority building:**

```python
# Inputs
feeder_upgrade_cost = $X  # From CPS Energy
feeder_capacity_kW = Y
bess_capacity_kW = Z
years_deferred = N  # Typically 5-10 years
discount_rate = 0.05  # 5% typical

# Calculation
proportional_deferral = (bess_capacity_kW / feeder_capacity_kW) × feeder_upgrade_cost

# NPV of deferring N years
npv_deferral = proportional_deferral × ((1 - (1/(1+discount_rate)^N)) / discount_rate)

# Annualized value (over 20-year BESS life)
annual_deferral_value = npv_deferral / 20
```

#### Step 4: Prioritize Buildings

**Rank buildings by total infrastructure value:**

1. **Tier 1 (Highest Value):**
   - On constrained feeders (>85% loaded)
   - Planned upgrades within 3 years
   - High upgrade costs (>$1M)
   - **Expected Deferral Value:** $100-400/kW-year

2. **Tier 2 (High Value):**
   - On moderately constrained feeders (75-85%)
   - Planned upgrades 3-7 years
   - Moderate upgrade costs ($500K-$1M)
   - **Expected Deferral Value:** $50-150/kW-year

3. **Tier 3 (Moderate Value):**
   - Growing load areas (60-75% current)
   - Upgrades planned 7+ years
   - Standard upgrade costs (<$500K)
   - **Expected Deferral Value:** $25-75/kW-year

4. **Tier 4 (Low Value):**
   - Unconstrained feeders (<60%)
   - No planned upgrades
   - **Expected Deferral Value:** $0-25/kW-year

**Deployment Strategy:** Start with Tier 1 buildings to maximize deferral value and prove model

### 5.2 Quantifying Resilience Value

**Methodology: Value of Lost Load (VOLL)**

**VOLL by Facility Type:**

| Facility Type | VOLL ($/kWh) | VOLL ($/kW-hour) | Justification |
|---------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Emergency Ops Center** | $50-100 | $50,000-100,000/MW-hr | Life-safety critical, irreplaceable during emergencies |
| **911 Call Center** | $40-80 | $40,000-80,000/MW-hr | Public safety, liability for service interruption |
| **Police/Fire Stations** | $30-60 | $30,000-60,000/MW-hr | Emergency response capability |
| **Water/Wastewater Control** | $20-40 | $20,000-40,000/MW-hr | Public health, environmental violations |
| **City Hall** | $5-15 | $5,000-15,000/MW-hr | Business continuity, productivity |
| **Standard Buildings** | $1-5 | $1,000-5,000/MW-hr | Baseline productivity loss |

**Historical Outage Data for San Antonio:**

**Sources:**
- CPS Energy reliability reports (SAIDI/SAIFI metrics)
- ERCOT emergency event history
- Winter Storm Uri (February 2021) impact data

**Typical Annual Outage Hours (San Antonio):**
- **Average Year:** 2-4 hours/year (per building)
- **Severe Weather Year:** 10-20 hours/year
- **Grid Emergency (Uri-level):** 50-100+ hours (rare but catastrophic)

**Conservative Annual Resilience Value Calculation:**

**Example: Emergency Operations Center**

```
Inputs:
- BESS Capacity: 100 kW
- Critical Load: 80 kW (emergency lighting, comms, HVAC)
- Backup Duration: 4 hours (200 kWh battery)
- Expected Outage Hours: 10 hours/year (conservative)
- VOLL: $60/kWh ($60,000/MWh)

Annual Resilience Value:
= Critical Load × Outage Hours Avoided × VOLL
= 80 kW × 10 hours × $60/kWh
= $48,000/year
```

**For Standard Building:**

```
Inputs:
- BESS: 100 kW
- Critical Load: 50 kW
- Expected Outages: 5 hours/year
- VOLL: $10/kWh

Annual Resilience Value:
= 50 kW × 5 hours × $10/kWh
= $2,500/year
```

### 5.3 Resilience Value by Building Type

**Estimated Annual Resilience Value (per 100 kW BESS):**

| Building Type | Critical Load (kW) | Outage Hours/yr | VOLL ($/kWh) | Annual Value |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Emergency Ops Center** | 80 | 10 | $60 | $48,000 |
| **911 Call Center** | 70 | 10 | $50 | $35,000 |
| **Police/Fire Station** | 60 | 8 | $40 | $19,200 |
| **Water Control Center** | 50 | 8 | $30 | $12,000 |
| **City Hall** | 40 | 5 | $10 | $2,000 |
| **Standard Building** | 30 | 5 | $5 | $750 |

**Fleet Average (38 buildings):**
- Assume 10-15 critical facilities: $20-50/kW-year resilience value
- Assume 23-28 standard buildings: $5-10/kW-year
- **Weighted Average:** ~$15-30/kW-year

**Conservative Estimate for Analysis:** $20/kW-year
**Including Critical Facilities:** $50/kW-year

### 5.4 Additional Resilience Benefits (Qualitative)

**Beyond VOLL, BESS provides:**

1. **Liability Reduction:**
   - Avoiding emergency service disruption during critical events
   - Meeting ADA requirements for accessible facilities
   - Maintaining public safety communications

2. **Insurance Value:**
   - Potential insurance premium reductions
   - Reduced business interruption exposure
   - Enhanced facility creditworthiness

3. **Regulatory Compliance:**
   - Meeting continuity of operations (COOP) requirements
   - Federal/state emergency preparedness standards
   - Public health code compliance

4. **Community Resilience:**
   - Supporting emergency response capability

## 6. Energy Arbitrage & Time-of-Use Optimization

### 6.1 CPS Energy TOU Rate Structure

**If buildings are on Time-of-Use rates:**

**Typical CPS Energy TOU Pricing:**

| Period | Summer (Jun-Sept) | Winter (Oct-May) | Differential |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **On-Peak** | $0.10-0.15/kWh | $0.07-0.10/kWh | Baseline |
| **Off-Peak** | $0.04-0.06/kWh | $0.03-0.05/kWh | -$0.06-0.09/kWh |
| **Peak Hours** | 1-7 PM weekdays | 6-9 AM, 5-9 PM | Variable |

**Arbitrage Opportunity:**
- Charge during off-peak: $0.04-0.06/kWh
- Discharge during on-peak: $0.10-0.15/kWh
- **Gross Margin:** $0.04-0.09/kWh

### 6.2 Annual Energy Arbitrage Value

**For 100 kW / 200 kWh BESS:**

**Daily Cycle Value:**
```
Charge: 200 kWh × $0.05/kWh = $10.00 cost
Discharge: 200 kWh × 90% efficiency × $0.12/kWh = $21.60 revenue
Gross Margin: $11.60/day
```

**Annual Cycles:**
- Conservative: 200 cycles/year (weekdays only, summer-focused)
- Moderate: 250 cycles/year (includes some winter optimization)
- Aggressive: 300 cycles/year (year-round optimization)

**Annual Energy Arbitrage Value:**
- **Conservative:** 200 cycles × $11.60 = $2,320/year = $23/kW-year
- **Moderate:** 250 cycles × $11.60 = $2,900/year = $29/kW-year
- **Aggressive:** 300 cycles × $11.60 = $3,480/year = $35/kW-year

**Typical Estimate:** **$30/kW-year**

### 6.3 Optimization Constraints

**Factors limiting arbitrage value:**

1. **DR Event Conflicts:**
   - Must reserve capacity for DR events (1-7 PM)
   - Cannot arbitrage during DR events (double-dipping prohibited)
   - Reduces available cycling days

2. **Demand Charge Management:**
   - Peak shaving takes priority over arbitrage
   - Must maintain state-of-charge for peak events
   - Limits full charge/discharge cycles

3. **Battery Degradation:**
   - Limiting cycles extends battery life
   - Trade-off between arbitrage revenue and replacement costs
   - Optimal: 200-250 cycles/year for 15-20 year life

**Recommended Strategy:**
- **Primary:** Demand charge reduction + DR participation
- **Secondary:** Energy arbitrage when not conflicting with primary use
- **Expected Achievable Value:** $20-40/kW-year

2. **Demand charge reduction is the largest, most predictable value stream** ($180-300/kW-year)
   - Guaranteed savings based on historical peak patterns
   - Should be the foundation of financial analysis

3. **Infrastructure deferral can significantly enhance economics** ($25-400/kW-year site-specific)
   - Requires CPS Energy distribution system data to quantify
   - Strategic site selection critical (constrained feeders = 3-5x higher value)

4. **Total value stack ranges from $356-833/kW-year** (conservative to aggressive)
   - **Base case: $522/kW-year** - supports strong project economics
   - **20-year NPV: $22.3M** on $4.5M investment
   - **IRR: 48%**, **Payback: 2.1 years**

5. **Project is highly attractive even without enhanced CPS Energy terms**
   - Demand charges alone ($220/kW-year) + ERCOT call option ($102/kW-year) = $322/kW-year
   - **Break-even at $300/kW-year** - 7% margin with just 2 revenue streams
