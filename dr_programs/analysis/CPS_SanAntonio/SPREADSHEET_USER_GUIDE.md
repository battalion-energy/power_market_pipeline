### 💰 Tab 3: Value Calculations
**What it shows:**
- Detailed revenue calculations for all 38 buildings
- 6 revenue streams calculated separately:
  1. Demand Charge Reduction
  2. CPS Energy DR
  3. ERCOT Call Option
  4. Infrastructure Deferral
  5. Resilience Value
  6. Energy Arbitrage
- Per-building and fleet-wide totals

**Action needed:**
✏️ **Update yellow assumption cells:**
- Summer/Winter demand charge rates (columns F, G) - from CPS tariffs
- Expected DR events per year (column L) - default 25
- DR payment rates (columns M, N) - currently $73 summer, $45 winter
- ERCOT call option value (column R) - currently $8.50/kW-month
- Feeder upgrade costs (column V) - from CPS Energy data (CRITICAL)
- Feeder capacities (column W) - from CPS Energy
- Years deferred (column X) - from CPS Energy upgrade timeline
- Annual arbitrage cycles (column AI) - default 220

**Key formulas (examples for Building B001, row 3):**
```excel
Demand Savings = (Summer_Peak*Summer_Rate*4_months + Winter_Peak*Winter_Rate*8_months)*80%
DR Revenue = BESS_kW * (Summer_Rate + Winter_Rate*Events/25)
ERCOT Revenue = BESS_kW * $8.50/kW-month * 12
Infrastructure Value = Upgrade_Cost * (BESS_kW/Feeder_kW) / 20_years
Total Annual = SUM(all 6 revenue streams)
```

**Critical data gap:** Infrastructure deferral requires CPS Energy feeder analysis!

### 🎯 Tab 7: Prioritization Scoring
**What it shows:**
- 100-point scoring system for all 38 buildings
- 5 scoring categories:
  1. Demand Charge Reduction (30 points max)
  2. Infrastructure Deferral Value (25 points max)
  3. DR + ERCOT Revenue (20 points max)
  4. Resilience Value (15 points max)
  5. Site Readiness (10 points max)
- Building rankings (1-38)
- Phase assignments (1, 2, or 3)

**Action needed:**
✏️ **Update yellow cells:**
- Electrical score (0-1) - after site electrical assessment
- Space score (0-1) - after site visit for battery space availability

**Scoring logic:**
```excel
1. Demand Charge Score = MIN(30, Annual_Savings/$30,000 * 30)
   → Buildings with >$30K savings get full 30 points

2. Infrastructure Score = Constraint_Multiplier * Timeline_Multiplier * 25
   → Constraint: 1.0 if feeder >90% loaded, 0.7 if >80%, 0.4 if >70%, 0.1 if <70%
   → Timeline: 1.0 if upgrade <3 years, 0.7 if <7 years, 0.4 if <10 years

3. DR+ERCOT Score = MIN(20, Annual_Revenue/$15,000 * 20)
   → Buildings with >$15K DR revenue get full 20 points

4. Resilience Score = Facility_Type_Multiplier * 15
   → Emergency Ops/911: 1.0 (15 pts)
   → Police/Fire: 0.8 (12 pts)
   → Water Control: 0.6 (9 pts)
   → City Hall: 0.4 (6 pts)
   → Standard: 0.1 (1.5 pts)

5. Site Readiness = (Electrical + Space) / 2 * 10
   → Each factor scored 0-1 (1 = ideal, 0.5 = workable, 0 = major issues)
```

**Color coding:**
- 🟢 Green (76-100 pts): Top priority, Phase 1
- 🟡 Yellow (51-75 pts): Medium priority, Phase 2
- 🔴 Red (0-50 pts): Lower priority, Phase 3

**Sample results:**
- Rank 1: Emergency Ops Center (86 points) - Phase 1
- Rank 2: 911 Call Center (84 points) - Phase 1
- Rank 10: Fire Station (76 points) - Phase 1
- Rank 11-25: Phase 2
- Rank 26-38: Phase 3

**This drives deployment decisions!**

## Critical Data Gaps to Fill

### PRIORITY 1: CPS Energy Distribution Data (CRITICAL!)
**Why critical:** Infrastructure deferral could be worth $25-150/kW-year ($95K-$570K fleet-wide)

**Request from CPS Energy Grid Planning (210-353-3333):**
1. Feeder ID for each of your 38 building addresses
2. Feeder capacity (kVA) and current peak load (kW)
3. Feeder loading percentage (current / capacity)
4. Planned infrastructure upgrades:
   - Which feeders need upgrades?
   - Cost estimates for each upgrade
   - Timeline (when upgrade is needed)
5. Buildings on each feeder (helps aggregate BESS impact)

**Template request letter:** See main analysis document Section 4.3

### PRIORITY 2: Building Interval Data
**Get 12 months of 15-minute interval data for each building:**
- Peak demands by month
- Time of peak (alignment with CPS system peak?)
- Peak-to-average ratio (indicates BESS sizing needs)
- Annual energy usage

**Request from:** CPS Energy or your City facilities team

### PRIORITY 3: Rate Schedule Confirmation
**Verify for each building:**
- Current rate schedule (LGS, GS, MLG, etc.)
- Summer demand charge ($/kW-month)
- Winter demand charge ($/kW-month)
- On-peak energy rate ($/kWh)
- Off-peak energy rate ($/kWh)

**Get from:** CPS Energy bills or account manager

### PRIORITY 4: Site Assessments
**For top 10-15 buildings, conduct site visits:**
- Electrical room space availability
- Electrical panel capacity and condition
- Interconnection point location
- Construction access and logistics
- Permitting considerations

## Using the Model for Decision-Making

### Decision 1: Should we proceed with the project?
**Look at:** Dashboard → Financial Summary
- **NPV > $0?** ✅ Yes ($22M) → Proceed
- **IRR > 15%?** ✅ Yes (48%) → Strong project
- **Payback < 5 years?** ✅ Yes (2.1) → Acceptable risk

**Sensitivity check:** Sensitivity Analysis → Scenarios
- **Worst case positive?** ✅ Conservative shows 28% IRR → Low risk

**Verdict:** Strong GO decision even without enhanced CPS terms

### Decision 2: Which buildings should we prioritize?
**Look at:** Prioritization Scoring → Rank column
- **Top 10 = Phase 1** (scores 76-100)
- Review individual scores by category
- Confirm Phase 1 buildings have:
  - High demand charge savings
  - Constrained feeders (if data available)
  - Critical facility status (bonus)
  - Good site readiness

**Action:** Deploy to top 10 first to prove model and maximize early ROI

### Decision 3: What size BESS for each building?
**Current model:** 100-150 kW per building (sample data)

**To optimize:**
1. Building Inventory tab → Review Peak Demand column
2. Target BESS = 60-80% of peak demand
3. Adjust Building Inventory → Column E (BESS Size)
4. Watch all tabs update automatically
5. Verify payback remains <3 years per building

**Rule of thumb:**
- 100 kW building peak → 75 kW BESS (75% ratio)
- 200 kW building peak → 150 kW BESS (75% ratio)

### Decision 4: Should we negotiate with CPS Energy?
**Look at:** Value Calculations → Infrastructure Deferral columns

**If infrastructure value is:**
- **$0-25/kW-year:** Standard DR program terms acceptable
- **$25-75/kW-year:** Negotiate 25% shared savings
- **$75-150/kW-year:** Negotiate 40% shared savings
- **>$150/kW-year:** Negotiate strategic partnership

**Negotiation targets:** (See main analysis Section 8.4)
- Option A: Enhanced DR payments (+$75/kW-year for constrained feeders)
- Option B: One-time infrastructure incentive ($200-400/kW)
- Option C: Multi-year contract (5 years for revenue certainty)

### Decision 5: How should we finance?
**Look at:** Financial Model → Key Metrics

**Options:**
1. **General Obligation Bonds (Recommended)**
   - Cost: 2-4% interest
   - Term: 20 years
   - Annual debt service: ~$332K
   - Net annual cash flow: $1.94M
   - ✅ Maximizes NPV

2. **Direct Purchase (Cash)**
   - CAPEX: $4.5M upfront
   - ✅ Highest long-term value
   - ✅ 48% IRR
   - Simple payback: 2.1 years

3. **ESPC (No upfront cost)**
   - ESCO finances and installs
   - City pays from savings
   - Typical split: 60% City / 40% ESCO
   - Net to City: $1.36M/year
   - ⚠️ Lower long-term value

**Recommendation:** GO Bonds or Direct Purchase for maximum value
