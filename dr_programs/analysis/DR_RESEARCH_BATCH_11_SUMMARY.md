## üèÜ Exceptional Discovery: Con Edison Distribution Load Relief Program

The standout finding from Batch 11 is the **Con Edison Distribution Load Relief Program (DLRP)**, which represents the **4th exceptional program** discovered across all batches.

### Program Excellence

**DLRP Key Metrics:**
- **Battery Suitability:** 8.5/10 (Very Good to Excellent)
- **Data Quality:** 8.5/10 (Very Good)
- **Payment Structure:**
  - Tier 1: $18/kW-month capacity
  - Tier 2: $25/kW-month capacity
  - Performance: $1/kWh
- **Annual Revenue:** $215K/year (DLRP only) or $365K/year (stacked with CSRP Tier 2)
- **Coverage:** 82 distribution network zones in NYC metro area
- **Response Time:** 0-2 hours (distribution-level)
- **Status:** Active, accepting new participants

**Why This Matters:**

1. **Distribution vs Transmission:** While most DR programs operate at transmission level (CSRP, Term-DLM), DLRP operates at distribution network level, providing localized grid support
2. **Stacking Opportunity:** Explicitly allows stacking with Con Edison CSRP, creating combined revenue of $365K/MW-year
3. **Higher Capacity Payments:** Tier 2 at $25/kW-month exceeds CSRP Tier 2 at $22/kW-month
4. **82 Network Zones:** Granular targeting enables precise compensation for locational value
5. **Faster Response:** 0-2 hour notification (vs 21 hours for CSRP) = premium for battery flexibility

**Revenue Comparison:**
```
CSRP Tier 2 alone:       $236-256K/MW-year
DLRP alone:              $215K/MW-year
DLRP + CSRP stacked:     $365K/MW-year  ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
NY Term-DLM + stacking:  $200-380K/MW-year
```

Con Edison now offers **three world-class battery programs**:
1. **CSRP Tier 2:** $236-256K/MW-year (transmission-level, 21-hour notice)
2. **Term/Auto-DLM:** $200-380K/MW-year (multi-year contracts, 10-minute response)
3. **DLRP:** $215-365K/MW-year (distribution-level, 0-2 hour response)

New York (Con Edison territory) solidifies position as **#1 US utility DR market** for battery energy storage.

---

## Database Quality Issues

### Issue 1: Program Misclassification

**Duke Energy SC On-Site Generation Service Program (Index 97):**
- **Status:** NOT a demand response program
- **Actual Type:** Standby service tariff / interconnection rate
- **Payment Direction:** Customer ‚Üí Utility (NOT a revenue source)
- **Purpose:** Backup service charges for customers with on-site generation
- **Action Required:** REMOVE from DR program database

**Correctly Identified Actual DR Program:**
- During research, identified Duke PowerShare (PS Rider) as the actual DR program
- PowerShare offers $5/kW to commercial customers for load curtailment
- PowerShare IS the DR program that should be in the database (and is - Index 98)

### Issue 2: Duplicate Programs

**Duke EnergyWise Business appears 3 times with minimal differentiation:**
- Index 79: Duke NC EnergyWise Business
- Index 96: Duke SC Carolinas EnergyWise Business
- Index 99: Duke SC Progress EnergyWise Business

While these serve different territories, they are essentially the **same program** with likely identical rates and structure. The database lists them separately because they serve different states, but this could be consolidated.

### Issue 3: Rate Transparency Crisis

**40% of battery-suitable programs** in Batch 11 do not disclose payment rates publicly:
- PGE OR: No rates published
- Xcel ND/SD: Tariff access required
- PSO OK: Rate stated but ambiguous
- PNM NM: No rates available

This is consistent with Batch 8 (30% transparency) and Batch 10 (similar issues), indicating **utility programs have systemic rate opacity** compared to ISO/RTO wholesale programs (which typically publish full rate schedules).

## Key Patterns and Insights

### Pattern 1: Utility Program Unsuitability

**Batch 11 shows HIGHEST unsuitability rate:**
- **71% unsuitable** (15 of 21 programs) for battery energy storage
- Includes: 6 residential AC programs, 2 agricultural programs, 2 HVAC commercial programs, 1 generator program, 1 EV program, 1 misclassified program, 1 rate reduction model, 1 tariff

**Comparison to Other Batches:**
- Batch 5 (MISO wholesale): 10% unsuitable (1 of 10)
- Batch 8 (utilities in ISO territories): 70% unsuitable (7 of 10)
- Batch 9 (MISO + utilities): 20% unsuitable (2 of 10, both duplicates)
- Batch 10 (utilities in ISO territories): 60% unsuitable (6 of 10)
- **Batch 11 (utilities, mostly non-ISO): 71% unsuitable (15 of 21)**

**Key Insight:** Programs in **vertically integrated utility territories** (Oklahoma, New Mexico, Oregon non-ISO portions, Carolinas, Florida) show highest unsuitability rates, while ISO/RTO wholesale programs show 90%+ suitability.

### Pattern 2: Rate Opacity in Utility Programs

**40% of battery-suitable programs** lack publicly available payment rates:
- This is consistent with Batch 8 (30% transparency) and Batch 10 findings
- ISO/RTO programs typically publish full rate schedules and forward curves
- Utility programs require direct contact or tariff book access

**Hypothesis:** Vertically integrated utilities negotiate rates individually with customers, while ISO/RTO markets require transparent public pricing.

### Pattern 3: Geographic Concentration of Excellence

**Programs by Excellence Tier:**

**Tier 1 States (Exceptional - $200K+):**
- New York (NYISO): 3 exceptional programs (CSRP, DLM, DLRP)
- MISO States (6 states): 1 exceptional program (capacity markets)

**Tier 2 States (Excellent - $100-200K):**
- PJM States (13 states): Multiple excellent programs

**Tier 3 States (Good - $50-100K):**
- California (CAISO): Multiple good programs

**Tier 4 States (Limited - $25-75K):**
- Oklahoma, Carolinas, possibly Oregon/NM with rate verification

**Tier 5 States (Poor/N/A):**
- States with only residential programs or HVAC-focused programs

**Key Insight:** States with **ISO/RTO markets** dominate Tiers 1-3, while **vertically integrated utility states** cluster in Tiers 4-5.

### Pattern 4: Con Edison's Distribution Innovation

**DLRP represents a new program category:**
- Previous DR programs operate at transmission level
- DLRP operates at distribution network level (82 zones)
- Enables highly localized grid support
- Faster response time (0-2 hours vs 21 hours)
- Higher payment rates for locational value
- Can stack with transmission-level programs (CSRP)

**Innovation Significance:**
- Other utilities may follow Con Edison's distribution-level DR model
- Creates additional revenue streams beyond transmission-level programs
- Increases total addressable market for battery DR participation
- Demonstrates battery value for distribution grid management

## Recommendations

### For Battery Developers

**TIER 1 MARKETS (Target First):**
1. **New York (Con Edison):** $350-380K/MW-year
   - Pursue all three programs: DLRP + CSRP or Term-DLM combinations
   - Multi-year contracts available (financing certainty)
   - World-class program design

2. **MISO States (6 states):** $149-219K/MW-year
   - Michigan Zone 7: Highest annual value ($243K/MW-year)
   - 3-5 year elevated pricing window (act now)
   - Record-breaking capacity prices

3. **PJM States (13 states):** $100-200K/MW-year
   - Mature, stable programs
   - Multiple program options
   - Good stacking opportunities

**TIER 2 MARKETS (Evaluate with Caution):**
4. **Oregon (PGE territory):** Unknown revenue (could be $80-170K/year range)
   - Contact PGE for rate verification FIRST
   - Year-round program is positive
   - No ISO market access limits stacking

5. **Dakotas (Xcel territory):** Unknown revenue
   - 35+ year program stability is positive
   - Must access tariff for rates
   - MISO market access in some areas

**TIER 3 MARKETS (NOT RECOMMENDED):**
6. **Oklahoma (PSO):** $6-40K/MW-year
   - Too low as primary revenue driver
   - Use as supplemental revenue only
   - SPP market provides better opportunities

7. **Carolinas (Duke Energy):** ~$60K/MW-year
   - 3-10x revenue disadvantage vs ISO markets
   - No wholesale market access
   - Focus on behind-the-meter value instead

8. **Avoid entirely:** States with only residential/agricultural/HVAC programs

### For Database Management

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

1. **Remove Misclassified Program:**
   - Duke Energy SC On-Site Generation (Index 97) is NOT a DR program
   - It's a standby service tariff where customers PAY the utility
   - Should be completely removed from database

2. **Consider Consolidating Duplicates:**
   - Duke EnergyWise appears 3 times (NC, SC Carolinas, SC Progress)
   - These are essentially the same program in different territories
   - Could consolidate with "multiple territories" notation

3. **Add Missing Programs:**
   - Several utilities mentioned alternative programs during research
   - Example: Xcel Battery Connect program (not in database)

4. **Flag Programs Requiring Rate Verification:**
   - Mark PGE OR, Xcel ND/SD, PSO OK, PNM NM as "rates TBD"
   - Provide contact information for rate requests
   - Note this affects 40% of battery-suitable programs in Batch 11

### For Future Research

**PRIORITY FOLLOW-UPS:**

1. **Con Edison DLRP Deep Dive:**
   - Request full program manual and zone maps
   - Analyze historical event frequency by network zone
   - Model optimal DLRP+CSRP stacking strategy
   - Identify highest-value zones (likely Manhattan, Brooklyn)

2. **Rate Verification Campaign:**
   - Contact PGE OR (503-610-2377) for Energy Partner rates
   - Contact Xcel Energy (1-800-481-4700) for ND/SD tariff books
   - Contact PSO for payment structure clarification
   - Contact PNM NM (505-241-4636) for Peak Saver rates

3. **Distribution-Level DR Trend Analysis:**
   - Survey other utilities for distribution-level programs
   - Con Edison DLRP may indicate emerging trend
   - Could unlock additional revenue tier beyond transmission DR

4. **Historical Event Data Collection:**
   - Build 3-5 year event history for programs with disclosed rates
   - Essential for modeling actual vs theoretical revenue
   - Enables cycle life impact analysis
