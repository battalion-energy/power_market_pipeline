## Notes for Developers

### JSON Schema Validation
Both files validate successfully against JSON standards:
```bash
python3 -m json.tool demand_response_schema.json
python3 -m json.tool demand_response_programs_catalog.json
```

### Schema Design
The schema supports:
- Multiple payment structures (capacity, performance, both)
- Seasonal variations in rates and windows
- Complex trigger conditions
- Historical event tracking
- Integration metadata for optimization

### Extensibility
To add new programs:
1. Use the schema as a template
2. Mark unavailable data explicitly
3. Include data_sources with URLs
4. Add integration_metadata for optimization context
5. Document event triggers clearly
