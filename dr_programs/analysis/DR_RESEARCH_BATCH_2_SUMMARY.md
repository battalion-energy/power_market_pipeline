## üéØ Battery Optimization Insights

### Best Programs for 1 MW / 4 MWh Battery:

**Scenario 1: New York Portfolio**
- Con Edison DLRP: $90-125K/season (May-Sept)
- Central Hudson TDR: $27K/season (June-Sept, if in constrained area)
- NYISO wholesale markets: Additional revenue
- **Total Potential:** $120-150K/year (DR only, excludes arbitrage)

**Scenario 2: California Portfolio**
- PG&E or SDGE CBP: $50-100K/season (May-Oct)
- CAISO energy arbitrage: High value spread
- ELRP-B2 stacking potential
- **Total Potential:** $100-200K/year

**Scenario 3: LADWP (Municipal)**
- LADWP DR: $60-80K/season (June-Oct)
- LADWP DSGS: Additional dispatch revenue potential
- Local arbitrage opportunities
- **Total Potential:** $80-120K/year

### Critical Factors for Battery Participation:

**Technical Requirements:**
- 15-minute interval metering (standard)
- Fast response capability (minutes) - batteries excel
- Telemetry/API integration (varies by program)
- Baseline calculation methodology (may need adaptation for batteries)

**Operational Considerations:**
- 2-hour advance notice: Sufficient for charge scheduling
- Day-ahead notice: Excellent for optimization
- Same-day notice: Limits pre-charging but favors fast response
- Event windows align with peak arbitrage opportunities

**Revenue Stacking:**
- NY: Can often stack utility DR + NYISO programs
- CA: CBP allows stacking with ELRP, SGIP, storage mandates
- Exclusions: Con Ed DLRP ‚ä• NWS, Central Hudson TDR ‚ä• CSRP

**Risk Factors:**
- Performance penalties: Batteries can meet 95%+ requirements
- Event frequency uncertainty: Limits revenue forecasting
- Program changes: Rates/rules may change annually
- Baseline issues: Traditional CBL may not suit batteries
