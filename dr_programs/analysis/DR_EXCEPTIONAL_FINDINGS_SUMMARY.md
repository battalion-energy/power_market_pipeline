2. **Revenue Certainty:** Multi-year contracts (DLM) + distribution premium (DLRP)
3. **Stacking Allowed:** Can combine 4-5 revenue streams legally
4. **Regulatory Support:** NY PSC strongly supports storage, climate goals mandate growth
5. **Behind-Meter Stack:** Add demand charges + TOU for additional $50-70K/MW-year

**Investment Size:**
- $1M per MW installed (battery + soft costs)
- $365K annual revenue per MW
- **36.5% gross annual return** before O&M
- **Simple payback: 3-4 years**
- **20-year NPV: Highly positive** at any reasonable discount rate

**MISO Investment Thesis:**

**Why Act Now (2025-2026):**
1. **Limited Window:** 3-5 years of $666.50/MW-day pricing (2025-2028)
2. **First-Mover Advantage:** Best interconnection positions + early program enrollment
3. **Proven Pricing:** Not speculative - MISO auction already cleared
4. **6-State Opportunity:** Deploy portfolio across multiple states

**Risk:**
- Pricing may decline 2029+ as new generation online
- Mitigation: 3-5 year ROI window captures elevated pricing period

### For Utilities (Outside NY/MISO)

**Lessons from Exceptional Programs:**

1. **Payment Transparency Matters:**
   - Con Edison publishes all rates: Drives participation
   - Opaque programs struggle to attract developers

   - Restrictive stacking rules limit revenue to $50-150K/MW-year
   - Recommendation: Allow stacking across non-competing programs

### For Policymakers

**How to Replicate NY/MISO Success:**

1. **Organize Wholesale Markets:** ISO/RTO structure delivers 3-10x higher value
2. **Battery-Specific Programs:** Design for 10-minute response, 0-2 hour notification
3. **Multi-Year Contracts:** Enable project financing certainty
4. **Distribution + Transmission:** Create both levels of DR programs
5. **Payment Transparency:** Publish all rates and forward curves
6. **Allow Stacking:** Don't restrict revenue combinations
7. **Regulatory Stability:** Long-term commitment (10+ years)

**States That Should Act:**
- California: Has ISO, should add distribution DR tier
- Texas: Has ERCOT, should add utility-level programs
- All PJM states: Add distribution DR to complement wholesale
- Non-ISO states: Organize markets OR significantly increase DR payments
