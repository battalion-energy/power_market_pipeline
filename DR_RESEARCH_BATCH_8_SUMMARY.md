# Demand Response Research - Batch 8 Summary
## Utility Programs Across Major ISO/RTO Territories

**Research Date:** 2025-10-11
**Programs Researched:** 10
**Geographic Coverage:** 5 ISO/RTO territories (NYISO, PJM, ERCOT, SPP, CAISO)
**Focus:** Utility-level demand response programs in organized wholesale market regions

---

## Executive Summary

Batch 8 researched utility demand response programs operating within major ISO/RTO territories, revealing a **dual market structure** where utilities offer retail DR programs that may or may not provide pathways to wholesale markets. Results show **60% battery-suitable programs** (6 of 10), significantly better than Batch 7's 30% but with critical data transparency issues.

### Key Findings:

1. **Payment Rate Opacity Persists**: 6 of 10 programs (60%) do not publicly disclose payment rates, requiring direct utility contact for economic analysis
2. **Two Excellent Battery Programs Found**: Con Edison CSRP (Tier 2: $216/kW-year + $1/kWh) and PG&E CBP (aggregated CAISO participation)
3. **Technology Exclusivity Issues**: 2 programs explicitly exclude batteries (SCE Summer Discount: A/C-only; SCE OBMC: likely inactive)
4. **Geographic Concentration**: 4 of 10 programs in Texas (ERCOT), 3 in California (CAISO), 2 in New York (NYISO), 1 each in Pennsylvania (PJM) and Arkansas (SPP)
5. **Wholesale Market Integration Unclear**: Most programs don't specify whether participants can simultaneously access ISO/RTO wholesale markets

### Quality Metrics:
- **Average Research Quality**: 6.2/10 (vs 8.8/10 for ISO/RTO wholesale programs in Batch 5)
- **Battery Suitability Distribution**:
  - Excellent: 2 programs (20%)
  - Good: 4 programs (40%)
  - Limited: 2 programs (20%)
  - Poor: 2 programs (20%)

### Strategic Insight:

Utility programs in ISO/RTO territories fall into three categories:
1. **Wholesale Aggregators** (PG&E CBP, FirstEnergy) - provide pathway to CAISO/PJM markets
2. **Independent Utility Programs** (Con Edison, NYSEG, Austin Energy) - operate separately from wholesale markets with utility-set rates
3. **Technology-Specific Programs** (SCE Summer Discount, Oncor) - exclude or have regulatory barriers for batteries

The **best opportunities** for battery operators remain direct ISO/RTO wholesale market participation, but some utility programs (Con Edison Tier 2, PG&E CBP) offer competitive revenue when wholesale access is limited.

## Key Data Gaps Across Batch 8

### Critical Missing Information

**Payment Rates (6 programs):**
- FirstEnergy PA (aggregator-dependent)
- CPS Energy TX (must contact account manager)
- Oncor TX (must contact EEPM Help Desk)
- SWEPCO AR (must contact program coordinator)
- PG&E CBP (aggregator-dependent)
- SCE OBMC (no payments)

**Baseline Methodologies (4 programs):**
- Austin Energy TX
- CPS Energy TX
- Oncor TX
- SWEPCO AR

**Battery Eligibility Confirmation (5 programs):**
- NYSEG NY (inferred but not explicit)
- CPS Energy TX (unclear, residential-only program exists)
- Oncor TX (regulatory barriers)
- Austin Energy TX (not explicitly mentioned)
- SWEPCO AR (not explicitly mentioned)

**Wholesale Market Stacking Rules (8 programs):**
Only Con Edison and PG&E have clear documentation on simultaneous ISO/RTO market participation.

## Strategic Insights

### 1. NYISO Sets Gold Standard for Transparency

Con Edison and NYSEG both provide:
- Publicly disclosed payment rates
- Clear baseline methodologies
- Well-documented event parameters
- Transparent enrollment processes
- Historical program performance data

**Recommendation:** NYISO utilities should be prioritized for battery DR participation.

---

### 2. Aggregator-Based Programs Trade Transparency for Expertise

PG&E CBP and FirstEnergy CIDR don't disclose rates publicly but provide:
- Professional aggregator management (CPower, Enel X, OhmConnect)
- Direct access to wholesale markets (CAISO, PJM)
- Sophisticated market optimization
- Regulatory compliance handling

**Trade-off:** Less transparency but potentially higher revenue through wholesale market access.

---

### 3. Texas (ERCOT) Utility Programs Generally Inferior to Wholesale

Of 4 Texas utility programs researched:
- **Austin Energy:** $65-80K/MW-year
- **CPS Energy:** Rates not disclosed
- **Oncor:** Regulatory barriers
- **Direct ERCOT Wholesale:** $100-200K/MW-year (typical)

**Recommendation:** Texas batteries should prioritize direct ERCOT wholesale participation (DAM, SCED, Ancillary Services) over utility DR programs.

---

### 4. California Programs Highly Variable

- **PG&E:** Excellent (aggregated CAISO access)
- **SCE:** Both programs unsuitable for batteries (OBMC: emergency-only no payment; Summer Discount: A/C-only)

**Geographic Arbitrage Opportunity:** Batteries in PG&E territory have superior utility DR options compared to SCE territory.

---

### 5. Payment Rate Opacity Limits Economic Analysis

60% of programs (6 of 10) don't disclose payment rates, creating:
- Impossible ROI calculations
- Difficult program comparisons
- Higher transaction costs (must contact each utility)
- Lack of competitive pricing discipline

**Contrast with ISO/RTO Programs:** Batch 5 MISO programs had 100% payment rate transparency through public capacity auction results.

| Excellent Programs | 10 | 0 | 1 | **2** |
| Top Revenue | $242K/MW | Not disclosed | $100K-150K | **$236-256K/MW** |

**Key Insight:** Batch 8 found 2 excellent battery programs (Con Edison, PG&E) with revenue comparable to ISO/RTO wholesale programs, but average quality remains lower due to payment rate opacity in 60% of programs.

---

## Conclusion

Batch 8 reveals a **fragmented utility DR landscape** within ISO/RTO territories:

**Winners (20%):** Con Edison CSRP Tier 2 and PG&E CBP offer world-class battery DR opportunities with revenues of $200-250K/MW-year, rivaling direct wholesale participation.

**Solid Options (40%):** Four programs (NYSEG, FirstEnergy, Austin Energy, SWEPCO) provide reasonable battery opportunities but require further investigation to obtain payment rates and confirm eligibility.

**Problematic (40%):** Four programs have significant limitations - payment rate opacity (CPS, Oncor, SWEPCO), regulatory barriers (Oncor), or battery ineligibility (SCE programs).

**Strategic Recommendation for Battery Operators:**

1. **First Choice:** Direct ISO/RTO wholesale market participation (highest revenue, full transparency)
2. **Excellent Alternatives:** Con Edison CSRP Tier 2 (NYISO) or PG&E CBP (CAISO) where wholesale access is limited
3. **Supplemental Revenue:** Consider utility programs that allow wholesale market stacking
4. **Avoid:** Technology-specific programs (A/C-only) and emergency-only programs with no payments

---

## Next Steps

### Batch 9 Strategy

Based on learnings from Batches 6-8, Batch 9 should focus on:

**Priority Areas:**
1. Remaining ISO/RTO wholesale programs (if any in database)
2. Large utility programs with documented battery participation
3. States with high renewable penetration (battery arbitrage opportunities)
4. Programs with public tariff sheets (higher transparency likelihood)

**Avoid:**
- Residential-only thermostat programs
- Small utility programs with no documented battery pathways
- Technology-specific programs (HVAC, generators-only)

**Geographic Focus:**
- Complete coverage of remaining CAISO programs
- Additional PJM territory programs
- ERCOT programs (document for completeness but note wholesale superiority)
- ISO-NE programs if available
