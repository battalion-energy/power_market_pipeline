# BESS Revenue Analysis: World-Class Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
Transform the current mock-data BESS revenue analyzer into a bank-grade, auditable system using only real ERCOT 60-day disclosure data and market prices. This will create a trustworthy tool for valuing BESS assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

## Current State Assessment

### Why Were These Hacks Put In Place?
The mock data was likely added because:
1. **Complexity of 60-day disclosure data** - Multiple file formats, schema evolution, massive size
2. **Time pressure** - Needed quick results, so hardcoded "reasonable" values
3. **Missing data pipeline** - Didn't have extracted/processed disclosure CSVs ready
4. **Algorithm complexity** - True optimization is much harder than simple thresholds
5. **Lack of domain knowledge** - Didn't understand ERCOT market operations deeply

### What We Actually Have
✅ **Extensive Real Data Available:**
- 12,662 DAM disclosure CSV files extracted
- 16,113 SCED disclosure CSV files extracted  
- Real BESS resources identified (ADL_BESS1, ALVIN_UNIT1, ANCHOR_BESS1/2, etc.)
- Settlement point price data in Parquet format
- AS clearing price data available

## World-Class Algorithm Requirements

### Core Principles for Bank-Grade Software
1. **Auditability** - Every calculation traceable to source data
2. **Reproducibility** - Same inputs always produce same outputs
3. **Transparency** - No black boxes or magic numbers
4. **Validation** - Cross-check against ERCOT settlement statements
5. **Version Control** - Track all data sources and algorithm versions
6. **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation with clear error reporting

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Foundation (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Build BESS Resource Registry
```rust
// Extract from 60-day DAM disclosure files
struct BessResource {
    resource_name: String,
    qse: String,                    // Qualified Scheduling Entity
    settlement_point: String,        // From mapping files
    max_capacity_mw: f64,           // From HSL in disclosure
    min_capacity_mw: f64,           // From LSL (can be negative for charging)
    storage_capacity_mwh: f64,      // From registration data
    efficiency: f64,                // From technical parameters
    initial_operation_date: Date,   // From ERCOT registration
    resource_id: String,            // ERCOT resource ID
}
```

**Data Sources:**
- Primary: `60d_DAM_Gen_Resource_Data-*.csv` (Resource Type = "PWRSTR")
- Secondary: ERCOT Resource Registration data
- Validation: Cross-check against ERCOT BESS fleet list

#### 1.2 Create Data Extractors
```rust
// Robust CSV readers with schema evolution handling
impl DisclosureDataExtractor {
    fn extract_dam_awards(date: Date, resource: &str) -> Result<DamAwards>
    fn extract_sced_dispatch(date: Date, resource: &str) -> Result<ScedDispatch>
    fn extract_cop_soc(date: Date, resource: &str) -> Result<StateOfCharge>
    fn extract_as_awards(date: Date, resource: &str) -> Result<AncillaryAwards>
}
```

### Phase 2: Core Algorithms (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Energy Arbitrage Optimization
```rust
// True optimization with all constraints
struct ArbitrageOptimizer {
    fn optimize_daily_schedule(
        bess: &BessResource,
        hourly_dam_prices: Vec<f64>,
        rt_prices_5min: Vec<f64>,
        initial_soc: f64,
    ) -> DailySchedule {
        // Use Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
        // Maximize: Σ(P_discharge * Price) - Σ(P_charge * Price)
        // Subject to:
        //   - SOC[t+1] = SOC[t] - discharge[t] + charge[t] * efficiency
        //   - 0 ≤ SOC[t] ≤ capacity_mwh
        //   - 0 ≤ charge[t] ≤ max_charge_mw
        //   - 0 ≤ discharge[t] ≤ max_discharge_mw
        //   - charge[t] * discharge[t] = 0 (can't do both)
        //   - SOC[0] = SOC[24] (daily cycling)
    }
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Use proper optimization solver (e.g., CBC, GLPK)
- Track SOC through entire period
- Account for round-trip efficiency correctly
- Handle multi-day optimization windows
- Consider degradation costs

#### 2.2 Ancillary Services Co-Optimization
```rust
struct ASOptimizer {
    fn co_optimize_energy_and_as(
        bess: &BessResource,
        dam_prices: Vec<f64>,
        as_prices: ASMarketPrices,
        technical_requirements: ASRequirements,
    ) -> CoOptimizedSchedule {
        // Maximize total revenue from energy + AS
        // Account for:
        //   - AS capacity reservation reduces energy capability
        //   - AS deployment affects SOC
        //   - Performance requirements for each AS product
        //   - Opportunity cost of AS vs energy
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Revenue Calculation Engine (Week 3)

#### 3.1 DAM Revenue Calculator
```rust
impl DamRevenueCalculator {
    fn calculate_energy_revenue(awards: &DamEnergyAwards, prices: &DamPrices) -> f64 {
        // Revenue = Σ(awarded_mw[h] * dam_price[h])
        // Track separately: charge cost, discharge revenue
    }
    
    fn calculate_as_revenue(awards: &ASAwards, clearing_prices: &ASPrices) -> ASRevenue {
        // RegUp: capacity_payment + mileage_payment
        // RegDown: capacity_payment + mileage_payment  
        // RRS: capacity_payment
        // ECRS: capacity_payment + performance_payment
        // NonSpin: capacity_payment
    }
}
```

#### 3.2 Real-Time Revenue Calculator
```rust
impl RTRevenueCalculator {
    fn calculate_rt_revenue(
        dam_schedule: &DamSchedule,
        actual_dispatch: &ScedDispatch,
        rt_prices: &RTPrices,
    ) -> RTRevenue {
        // Revenue = Σ((actual_mw - dam_mw) * rt_price)
        // This captures deviations from DAM schedule
        // Must track:
        //   - Instructed deviations (following SCED)
        //   - Self-scheduled changes
        //   - AS deployments
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Validation & Backtesting (Week 4)

#### 4.1 Historical Validation
```rust
struct Backtester {
    fn validate_against_actual(
        calculated: &CalculatedRevenue,
        settlement_statements: &SettlementData,
    ) -> ValidationReport {
        // Compare our calculations to actual ERCOT settlements
        // Identify and explain any discrepancies
        // Should match within rounding error (<0.01%)
    }
}
```

#### 4.2 Performance Metrics
```rust
struct PerformanceAnalyzer {
    fn calculate_metrics(results: &BessRevenue) -> PerformanceMetrics {
        revenue_per_mw: f64,           // $/MW-year
        revenue_per_mwh: f64,          // $/MWh of throughput
        capacity_factor: f64,          // Actual vs max possible cycles
        round_trip_efficiency: f64,    // Actual achieved
        as_performance_score: f64,     // AS delivery accuracy
        daily_cycles: f64,             // Average cycles per day
    }
}
```

### Phase 5: Production System (Week 5)

#### 5.1 Data Pipeline
```yaml
data_pipeline:
  1_extract:
    - Download 60-day disclosure ZIPs
    - Extract CSVs with validation
    - Check data completeness
    
  2_transform:
    - Parse disclosure formats
    - Handle schema evolution
    - Create normalized tables
    
  3_load:
    - Store in PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB
    - Create materialized views
    - Build indexes for queries
```

#### 5.2 API & Reporting
```rust
struct BessRevenueAPI {
    // RESTful API for revenue queries
    GET /api/v1/bess/{resource_id}/revenue/daily?date={date}
    GET /api/v1/bess/{resource_id}/revenue/monthly?year={year}&month={month}
    GET /api/v1/bess/{resource_id}/revenue/annual?year={year}
    
    // Detailed breakdowns
    GET /api/v1/bess/{resource_id}/revenue/components?date={date}
    // Returns: energy_arbitrage, regup, regdown, rrs, ecrs, nonspin
}
```

## Critical Questions to Resolve

### Data Questions
1. **Q: How do we map BESS resources to settlement points?**
   - A: Use QSE-to-Settlement Point mapping from ERCOT Network Model files

2. **Q: Where do we get actual storage capacity (MWh)?**
   - A: ERCOT Resource Asset Registration Forms (RARFs) or estimate from typical duration (2-4 hours)

3. **Q: How do we handle schema changes over time?**
   - A: Already implemented schema normalization - extend to disclosure files

### Algorithm Questions
4. **Q: Should we use perfect foresight or rolling optimization?**
   - A: Start with perfect foresight for backtesting, add rolling window for operations

5. **Q: How do we handle AS deployment uncertainty?**
   - A: Use historical deployment rates from disclosure data

6. **Q: What about real-time price volatility?**
   - A: Include volatility metrics and confidence intervals

### Business Questions
7. **Q: What time periods should we analyze?**
   - A: Start with 2023-2024 (good data quality, many BESS online)

8. **Q: Which BESS resources are priority?**
   - A: Focus on largest (>100MW) and newest (better data)

9. **Q: How do we handle confidential information?**
   - A: Use only public 60-day disclosure data, no private info
