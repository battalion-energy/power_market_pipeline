# BESS Revenue Implementation Checklist

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS - REMOVE ALL HACKS

### üóëÔ∏è DELETE Mock Data (TODAY)
- [ ] Remove ALL hardcoded BESS resources from bess_parquet_analyzer.rs
- [ ] Delete fake price thresholds ($20/$30)
- [ ] Remove fabricated AS revenue calculations
- [ ] Delete simulated chart data
- [ ] Remove "ensures profitable spreads" language

### üîç Find REAL Data Sources
- [x] **VERIFIED:** 12,662 DAM disclosure CSV files available
- [x] **VERIFIED:** 16,113 SCED disclosure CSV files available
- [x] **VERIFIED:** Real BESS resources exist (ADL_BESS1, ANCHOR_BESS1/2, etc.)
- [ ] Extract full BESS fleet list from disclosures
- [ ] Map resources to settlement points
- [ ] Get actual storage capacities (MWh)

## CORE IMPLEMENTATION - NO SHORTCUTS

### üìä Phase 1: Real BESS Registry
```sql
-- Create from 60-day disclosures
CREATE TABLE bess_resources AS
SELECT DISTINCT
    resource_name,
    qse,
    MAX(hsl) as max_capacity_mw,
    MIN(lsl) as min_capacity_mw,
    settlement_point_name
FROM dam_gen_resource_data
WHERE resource_type = 'PWRSTR'
GROUP BY resource_name, qse, settlement_point_name;
```

### ‚ö° Phase 2: Real Energy Calculations
```python
def calculate_arbitrage(bess, prices, initial_soc):
    """
    REAL optimization with constraints:
    - SOC limits: 0 ‚â§ SOC ‚â§ capacity_mwh
    - Power limits: -P_max ‚â§ P ‚â§ P_max
    - Can't charge and discharge simultaneously
    - Round-trip efficiency losses
    - Must have energy to discharge
    """
    # NO FAKE THRESHOLDS
    # Use actual optimization (MILP/Dynamic Programming)
    pass
```

### üí∞ Phase 3: Real Revenue Tracking
```python
def calculate_actual_revenue(resource, date):
    """
    Pull ACTUAL data:
    - DAM awards from 60d_DAM_Gen_Resource_Data
    - RT dispatch from 60d_SCED_Gen_Resource_Data
    - Actual prices from parquet files
    - AS awards from disclosure files
    """
    # NO MADE UP NUMBERS
    pass
```

## VALIDATION - TRUST BUT VERIFY

### ‚úÖ Validation Requirements
- [ ] Compare to ERCOT settlement statements
- [ ] Cross-check with public BESS performance reports
- [ ] Validate SOC feasibility
- [ ] Ensure energy balance (charge = discharge / efficiency)
- [ ] Check against physical limits

### üìà Performance Metrics
- [ ] Revenue per MW-year (should be $50k-$200k)
- [ ] Daily cycles (typically 1-2)
- [ ] Round-trip efficiency (should be 85-90%)
- [ ] AS performance score

## TIMELINE

### Day 1 (NOW)
- [x] Delete hack Python script
- [ ] Remove ALL mock data from Rust code
- [ ] Start extracting real BESS list

### Week 1
- [ ] Build BESS registry from disclosures
- [ ] Create proper data extractors
- [ ] Map to settlement points

### Week 2
- [ ] Implement real optimization
- [ ] Add all constraints
- [ ] Track SOC properly

### Week 3
- [ ] Calculate real revenues
- [ ] Validate against known data
- [ ] Document methodology

## NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES

### üö´ NEVER
- Use hardcoded values for real analysis
- Make up data when real data exists
- Use arbitrary thresholds instead of optimization
- Claim guarantees we can't verify
- Process hacked/modified source files

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS
- Use source data directly
- Handle schema issues in the reader, not the file
- Document data sources
- Validate calculations
- Be transparent about limitations

## Questions That MUST Be Answered

1. **Storage Capacity**: Where exactly do we get MWh capacity?
   - Option A: ERCOT registration data
   - Option B: Infer from operations (max SOC observed)
   - Option C: Industry standard ratios (2-4 hour duration)

2. **Efficiency**: Where do we get round-trip efficiency?
   - Option A: Technical specs from manufacturers
   - Option B: Calculate from actual charge/discharge data
   - Option C: Use industry standard (85-90%)

3. **Initial SOC**: How do we initialize state of charge?
   - Option A: COP snapshots have this
   - Option B: Assume empty at midnight
   - Option C: Optimize over multi-day windows

4. **AS Deployment**: How much AS actually gets called?
   - Option A: Calculate from historical deployments
   - Option B: Use ERCOT's deployment factors
   - Option C: Probabilistic modeling

## Success Metrics

### Minimum Viable Product
- [ ] Load real BESS resources
- [ ] Calculate energy arbitrage with constraints
- [ ] Show actual DAM awards
- [ ] No mock data anywhere

### Production Ready
- [ ] All revenues from real data
- [ ] Validated against settlements
- [ ] Handles all edge cases
- [ ] Full audit trail

### World Class
- [ ] Real-time updates
- [ ] Predictive analytics
- [ ] Portfolio optimization
- [ ] Risk management

## The Bottom Line

**We have the data.** Stop making it up.
**We have the algorithms.** Stop using shortcuts.
**We have the compute.** Stop compromising.

Build it right or don't build it at all.
