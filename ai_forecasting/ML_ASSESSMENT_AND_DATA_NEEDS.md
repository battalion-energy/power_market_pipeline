# ERCOT ML Model Assessment & Data Requirements
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Purpose:** Comprehensive assessment of ML models built, data available, and gaps to address

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

You've made excellent progress on **Model 3 (RT Price Spike Prediction)** which achieved **AUC 0.93** (exceeding the 0.88 industry benchmark). However, you still need to implement:
- **Model 1**: Day-Ahead Price Forecasting (with confidence intervals)
- **Model 2**: Real-Time Price Forecasting (with confidence intervals)
- **Ancillary Services Price Prediction** (new requirement)

**Critical Finding:** Your 2024-2025 training data has only **103 price spike events** (0.19% rate). Expanding to 2019-2025 gives you **2,187 spikes** - a **21x increase** in training examples, which will dramatically improve model performance.

---

### ‚ùå Model 2: Real-Time Price Forecasting (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Status:** Architecture designed but NOT coded
**Target:** Predict 5-min RT LMP 1-6 hours ahead

**What you need to build:**
1. **Point predictions:** Single RT price forecast
2. **Confidence intervals:**
   - 75th/25th percentile
   - 95th/5th percentile
   - Higher uncertainty than DA (RT is more volatile)

**Proposed architecture:**

### ‚ùå Ancillary Services Price Prediction (NEW REQUIREMENT)

**Status:** Not designed or implemented
**Your question:** Can RT/DA price + demand be a proxy for AS price bids?

**Answer:** **Partially, but you need dedicated AS models.**

**Key insights about AS pricing:**

ERCOT has 5 ancillary service products:
1. **REGUP** (Regulation Up) - Frequency control
2. **REGDN** (Regulation Down) - Frequency control
3. **RRS** (Responsive Reserve) - Primary frequency response
4. **NSPIN** (Non-Spinning Reserves) - 30-min startup
5. **ECRS** (ERCOT Contingency Reserve) - Emergency reserves

**Correlation analysis needed:**
```python
# You should analyze:
correlation = df[['rt_lmp', 'da_lmp', 'load', 'REGUP', 'REGDN', 'RRS', 'NSPIN', 'ECRS']].corr()
```

**Hypothesis to test:**
- **High correlation scenarios** (RT/DA price is good proxy):
  - Scarcity pricing ‚Üí High AS prices (ORDC-driven)
  - Peak demand hours ‚Üí Higher AS requirements
  - Low reserves ‚Üí Both energy and AS prices spike

- **Low correlation scenarios** (need dedicated models):
  - Renewable ramps ‚Üí High regulation needs, normal energy prices
  - Forecast errors ‚Üí Regulation prices spike, energy stable
  - Frequency events ‚Üí RRS/REGUP spike independently

**Recommendation:**
Build **Model 4: Multi-Product AS Price Forecasting**
- **Input features:**
  - DA/RT prices (as features, not primary drivers)
  - System demand and load forecast errors
  - Net load ramps (load - wind - solar changes)
  - Reserve margins
  - Wind/solar forecast errors (drive regulation needs)
  - Historical AS prices (24h, 168h lags)
  - Frequency deviation metrics (if available)

- **Output:**
  - Forecast for all 5 AS products simultaneously
  - Multi-task learning (shared features, separate heads)
  - Confidence intervals for bidding strategy

**Data available:**
- ‚úÖ AS prices (hourly): 2010-2025
  - Location: `/rollup_files/flattened/AS_prices_YYYY.parquet`
  - All 5 products: REGUP, REGDN, RRS, NSPIN, ECRS

## 3. CRITICAL DATA GAPS & PRIORITIZATION

### üî¥ CRITICAL (Must Have for Production Models)

#### 1. Load Forecast Errors
**Why critical:**
- Unexpected demand is #1 driver of RT price spikes
- Load forecast error correlates with reserve depletion
- Heat waves/cold snaps drive both load and prices

**Data source:** ERCOT publishes hourly load forecasts
- **STF** (Short-Term Forecast): 48 hours ahead
- **MTF** (Mid-Term Forecast): 7 days ahead
- **LTF** (Long-Term Forecast): 60 days ahead

**Action:**
```bash
# Download historical load forecasts
python scripts/download_ercot_load_forecasts.py --start 2019-01-01 --end 2025-10-28
```

**Feature engineering:**
```python
load_error_mw = actual_load - forecast_load
load_error_pct = (actual_load - forecast_load) / forecast_load * 100
load_error_cumulative_3h = sum(load_error[t-3:t])
```

#### 2. ORDC Reserve Data
**Why critical:**
- ORDC (Operating Reserve Demand Curve) directly drives scarcity pricing
- Reserve margin < 3000 MW triggers price adders
- Reserve margin < 2000 MW ‚Üí $1000+ prices common
- Reserve margin < 1000 MW ‚Üí $5000+ prices

**Data source:** 60-day SCED disclosure files
**Location:** `/ERCOT_data/csv_files/60d_SCED_*.csv`

**Action:** Extract these columns:
- Online reserves (MW)
- Reserve margin (%)
- ORDC adder ($/MWh)
- Distance to trigger prices (3000MW, 2000MW, 1000MW)

**Feature engineering:**
```python
reserve_margin = online_reserves / system_load * 100
reserve_error = forecast_reserves - actual_reserves
ordc_scarcity_level = (reserve_margin < 5.0).astype(int)  # Critical threshold
```

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY (Improves Model Performance)

#### 3. Historical Wind/Solar Forecasts (2019-2023)
**Status:** You're downloading this now
**Why important:**
- Wind/solar forecast errors drive RT price volatility
- Unexpected renewable drop ‚Üí supply shortfall ‚Üí price spike
- Current models only have 2024-2025 forecast errors

**Expected improvement:**
- Model 3 (spike): AUC 0.93 ‚Üí 0.95+ (more training data)
- Model 2 (RT price): MAE improvement ~20%

#### 4. Transmission Constraint Indicators
**Why important:**
- Binding constraints create locational price spreads
- Hub prices spike when transmission is constrained
- Affects arbitrage between hubs

**Data source:** 60-day SCED files (constraint columns)

### üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

#### 5. Generator Outage Capacity
- Planned outages reduce available supply
- Unplanned outages can trigger price spikes
- Seasonal patterns (summer maintenance vs winter weather)

#### 6. Frequency Deviation Metrics
- Drives regulation (REGUP/REGDN) prices
- Useful for AS price prediction (Model 4)

## 4. RECOMMENDED TRAINING DATA STRATEGY

### Option A: Start with 2019-2025 Full Dataset (RECOMMENDED)

**Pros:**
- 2,187 price spike events (vs 103 in 2024-2025)
- 21x more training data for rare events
- Captures Winter Storm Uri (813 spikes) - extreme case study
- Captures market regime changes (renewable growth)

**Cons:**
- Wind/solar forecast errors only for 2024-2025
- Need to use actual generation as proxy for 2019-2023

**Action:**
```bash
# Use the already-prepared multi-horizon dataset
python ml_models/train_multihorizon_model.py \
  --data-file /pool/ssd8tb/data/iso/ERCOT/ercot_market_data/ERCOT_data/master_features_multihorizon_2019_2025.parquet \
  --epochs 100 --batch-size 256
```

### Option B: Wait for Complete Forecast Data

**Pros:**
- Full feature set (forecast errors for all years)
- More accurate modeling

**Cons:**
- Delays model development by weeks/months
- Actual generation is 80% as good as forecast errors

**Recommendation:** **Don't wait! Start with Option A.**

## 5. MODEL IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Retrain Model 3 with 2019-2025 Data (THIS WEEK)

**Current status:** Trained on 2024-2025 only (3 spike examples)
**Action:** Retrain on 2019-2025 (2,187 spike examples)

**Expected results:**
- Better generalization (more diverse spike patterns)
- Higher recall (catch more spikes)
- More robust to market regime changes

**Code exists:**
```bash
cd /home/enrico/projects/power_market_pipeline
uv run python ml_models/train_multihorizon_model.py --epochs 100
```

### Phase 2: Implement Model 1 - DA Price Forecasting (WEEK 2-3)

**Architecture:** LSTM-Attention hybrid

**Implementation steps:**
1. Create `/ml_models/da_price_model.py`:
   - LSTM layers (3 layers, 512 units)
   - Self-attention mechanism
   - Output: Point prediction + uncertainty

2. Create training script with quantile regression:
   ```python
   # Train 3 models: p50 (median), p25, p75
   model_median = train_model(quantile=0.50)
   model_p25 = train_model(quantile=0.25)
   model_p75 = train_model(quantile=0.75)
   ```

3. Features to use:
   - Temporal (hour, day, month cyclical)
   - Lagged DA prices (24h, 168h)
   - AS prices (REGUP, REGDN, RRS, NSPIN, ECRS)
   - Weather (temperature, wind, solar forecasts)
   - Actual wind/solar generation (proxy until forecasts ready)

**Target metrics:**
- MAE < $5/MWh (median prediction)
- 75% coverage of p25-p75 interval
- 90% coverage of p5-p95 interval

### Phase 3: Implement Model 2 - RT Price Forecasting (WEEK 3-4)

**Architecture:** TCN-LSTM

**Implementation steps:**
1. Create `/ml_models/rt_price_model.py`:
   - Temporal Convolutional Network (6 residual blocks)
   - LSTM layers (2 layers, 384 units)
   - Attention pooling
   - Multi-quantile output heads

2. Features to use:
   - All DA model features PLUS:
   - Lagged RT prices (5min, 1h, 6h)
   - DA-RT spread (basis)
   - Net load and ramps
   - Price volatility (rolling std)

**Target metrics:**
- MAE < $15/MWh (RT is more volatile than DA)
- Quantile coverage: 80-90%

### Phase 4: Implement Model 4 - AS Price Prediction (WEEK 5-6)

**Architecture:** Multi-task learning (shared encoder, separate heads)

**Implementation steps:**
1. Create `/ml_models/as_price_model.py`:
   - Shared feature encoder (LSTM or Transformer)
   - 5 separate output heads (one per AS product)
   - Quantile regression for each head

2. Features to use:
   - System demand and load ramps
   - Net load ramps (renewable variability)
   - Wind/solar forecast errors (drive regulation needs)
   - Frequency deviation (if available)
   - Historical AS prices (24h, 168h lags)
   - RT/DA prices (as features, not targets)

**Output:**
- Predict all 5 AS products: REGUP, REGDN, RRS, NSPIN, ECRS
- Confidence intervals for bidding optimization

---

## 6. ANCILLARY SERVICES PRICING ANALYSIS

### Can RT/DA Price + Demand Predict AS Prices?

**Short answer:** Partially, but correlations vary by AS product.

**Analysis to perform:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data
rt_prices = pd.read_parquet('/pool/ssd8tb/data/iso/ERCOT/ercot_market_data/ERCOT_data/rollup_files/flattened/RT_prices_15min_2024.parquet')
da_prices = pd.read_parquet('/pool/ssd8tb/data/iso/ERCOT/ercot_market_data/ERCOT_data/rollup_files/flattened/DA_prices_2024.parquet')
as_prices = pd.read_parquet('/pool/ssd8tb/data/iso/ERCOT/ercot_market_data/ERCOT_data/rollup_files/flattened/AS_prices_2024.parquet')

# Aggregate RT to hourly (to match AS hourly resolution)
rt_hourly = rt_prices.resample('H').agg({
    'HB_HOUSTON': ['mean', 'max', 'std']
}).reset_index()

# Merge all datasets
merged = rt_hourly.merge(da_prices, on='datetime').merge(as_prices, on='datetime')

# Calculate correlations
corr_matrix = merged[['rt_mean', 'rt_max', 'rt_std', 'da_lmp', 'system_load',
                       'REGUP', 'REGDN', 'RRS', 'NSPIN', 'ECRS']].corr()

print(corr_matrix)
```

**Expected findings:**

| AS Product | Likely Correlation with RT/DA | Primary Driver |
|------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **RRS** (Responsive Reserve) | HIGH (0.6-0.8) | Scarcity pricing (ORDC) |
| **NSPIN** (Non-Spin) | MEDIUM-HIGH (0.5-0.7) | Scarcity + forecast error |
| **REGUP** (Reg Up) | MEDIUM (0.4-0.6) | Net load ramps + frequency |
| **REGDN** (Reg Down) | LOW-MEDIUM (0.3-0.5) | Renewable ramps (solar/wind) |
| **ECRS** (Contingency) | HIGH (0.6-0.8) | Emergency scarcity |

**Implications for bidding:**

1. **Energy arbitrage strategy** (high correlation):
   - When RT prices spike ‚Üí AS prices (RRS, NSPIN, ECRS) also spike
   - Opportunity cost: Holding reserves vs energy arbitrage
   - Decision: If RT price > $500 + AS price, discharge for energy

2. **Regulation strategy** (medium correlation):
   - REGUP/REGDN driven by renewable ramps, not just price
   - Need forecast error predictions, not just RT/DA prices
   - Better proxy: Wind/solar forecast errors + net load ramps

3. **Recommended AS bidding approach:**
   ```python
   # Don't use RT/DA price alone - build dedicated AS model

   # For RRS/NSPIN/ECRS (high correlation):
   as_price_estimate = f(rt_price, reserve_margin, ordc_adder)

   # For REGUP/REGDN (low correlation):
   reg_price_estimate = f(net_load_ramp, wind_solar_error, frequency_deviation)
   ```

**Conclusion:** Build **Model 4 (AS Price Prediction)** as a separate model. RT/DA prices are useful features but not sufficient proxies alone.
