# Next Model Revision Plan - Critical Improvements

## User's Key Insights (ALL CORRECT!)

### 1. **Generator Outages - CRITICAL MISSING FEATURE**
**Status:** In progress - data found, timestamp parsing needs fix

**Why Critical:**
- Large thermal outages (>10,000 MW) directly reduce supply → price spikes
- Mean outages: 13,827 MW (always significant capacity offline)
- 28.7% of hours have >20,000 MW out (CRITICAL scarcity)
- 10.4% of hours see sudden outages >2,000 MW (unplanned shocks)

**Data:** `Hourly Resource Outage Capacity` - 5.2M records
**Action:** Fix timestamp parsing, add to model

---

### 2. **BESS (Battery Storage) - GAME CHANGER**
**Status:** TODO - URGENT!

**Why Critical:**
- **BESS changes market dynamics:**
  - Charges during low prices → increases demand → raises prices
  - Discharges during high prices → increases supply → lowers prices
  - Acts as both load and generation
- **RAPID growth 2019-2025:**
  - 2019: Almost no BESS (<100 MW)
  - 2025: Thousands of MW operational
  - Market behavior is fundamentally different now!

**Data Sources:**
1. **SCED Real-Time Gen Data:** Sum all ESS/BESS resources
   - Look for fuel type = "STORAGE" or "ESR" (Energy Storage Resource)
   - Positive = discharge (generation)
   - Negative = charge (load)

2. **Metrics Needed:**
   - `bess_dispatch_MW` (net: positive = discharge, negative = charge)
   - `bess_charging_MW` (when negative)
   - `bess_discharging_MW` (when positive)
   - `bess_state_of_charge_pct` (if available)
   - `total_bess_capacity_MW` (grows over time!)

**Action:** Extract from SCED 5-minute data, aggregate hourly

### 3. **Training Period - MARKET REGIME CHANGE**
**Status:** CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION

**User's Insight: ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!**

**Problem with 2019-2025 Training:**
```
2019-2021: Old Market          | 2023-2025: New Market
- Minimal solar                | - Massive solar growth
- Almost no BESS               | - Significant BESS (GW scale)
- Different ORDC rules         | - Updated ORDC
- Pre-Winter Storm Uri         | - Post-Uri regulations
- Old weather patterns         | - Climate effects intensifying
```

**Recommendation:**
```python
# CURRENT (problematic):
training_data = 2019-01-01 to 2025-05-08  # 6+ years, mixed regimes

# PROPOSED (better):
training_data = 2023-01-01 to 2025-05-08  # 2+ years, current market

# OR EVEN BETTER:
training_data = 2024-01-01 to 2025-05-08  # 1+ year, very recent
```

**Rationale:**
- **More relevant patterns:** Recent market dynamics with BESS/solar
- **Better forecasts:** Model learns current market, not obsolete patterns
- **Faster training:** Less data = faster iterations
- **Avoid confusion:** Don't mix pre-BESS and post-BESS eras

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Less data (but 2+ years is plenty for hourly data)
- ✅ More relevant data (quality > quantity!)
- ✅ Captures current market regime
- ✅ Includes high BESS penetration

## Priority Action Items

### Phase 1 (For Demo - Current Fast Model)
- [x] Net load features
- [x] Reserve margin
- [x] Weather/temperature
- [ ] Fix outage data timestamps
- [ ] **Skip BESS for demo** (time constraint)

### Phase 2 (Next Model Revision - CRITICAL)
1. **Add BESS dispatch data**
   - Extract from SCED 5-min data
   - Aggregate to hourly
   - Calculate net charge/discharge
   - Track capacity growth over time

2. **Add generator outage capacity**
   - Fix timestamp parsing
   - Merge into master dataset
   - Especially critical for thermal outages

3. **UPDATE TRAINING PERIOD**
   - **Recommend: 2023-01-01 to 2025-05-08**
   - Or: 2024-01-01 to 2025-05-08 for most recent
   - Test both and compare validation loss
   - Document why we're excluding 2019-2022

4. **Feature Engineering**
   ```python
   # Supply-demand balance
   available_supply = capacity - outages + bess_discharge

   # Scarcity risk
   supply_margin = available_supply - load - reserves_requirement

   # BESS impact
   bess_net_impact = bess_discharge - bess_charge

   # Renewable vs controllable supply
   controllable_gen = thermal - thermal_outages + bess_discharge
   ```

5. **Model Architecture**
   - Current: 665K params (fast demo model)
   - Next: Maybe 2-3M params with more features
   - Add BESS features to historical inputs
   - Add outage features to historical inputs

---

## Data Processing Scripts Needed

### 1. `extract_bess_from_sced.py`
```python
# Find all ESS resources in SCED real-time generation data
# Aggregate to hourly
# Calculate:
#   - Total BESS dispatch (MW)
#   - Charging vs discharging split
#   - Number of active BESS resources (growing over time)
#   - Total installed BESS capacity
```

### 2. `fix_outage_timestamps.py`
```python
# Parse original Date + HourEnding columns correctly
# Current issue: all timestamps show 1970-01-01
# Need to parse MM/DD/YYYY format from Date column
```

### 3. `create_master_dataset_2023_2025.py`
```python
# Filter master dataset to recent market regime only
# Rationale: Don't train on obsolete pre-BESS patterns
# Include all new features: net load, reserves, outages, BESS
```

## Expected Impact

### With Outages Only:
- **+15-25% accuracy on spike events**
- Better capture of supply-side shocks
- Improved high-price forecasts

### With BESS + Outages:
- **+25-35% accuracy on spike events**
- Capture load/gen switching behavior
- Better low-price forecasts (BESS charging)
- Better high-price forecasts (BESS discharging)

### With 2023-2025 Training Period:
- **+10-20% overall accuracy**
- More relevant to current market
- Better generalization to 2025+ data
- Faster training (less data)

### Combined:
- **Potential 40-50% improvement over baseline**
- Especially for extreme events (>$100/MWh)
- Better capture of scarcity dynamics
- More realistic forecasts for trading decisions

## Key Takeaways

1. **User is 100% right about BESS** - it's a game changer we're missing
2. **User is 100% right about training period** - 2019 data is obsolete
3. **Outages are critical** - we found the data, just need to fix timestamps
4. **Market has fundamentally changed** - model must reflect 2023-2025 dynamics
5. **Quality > Quantity** - 2 years of relevant data beats 6 years of mixed regimes
