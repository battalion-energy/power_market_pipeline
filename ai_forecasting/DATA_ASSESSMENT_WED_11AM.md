## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FINDING

**The overnight transfer brought RECENT data (2024-2025), NOT historical data back to 2019.**

This means:
- ‚ùå No ORDC reserves from 2019-2021 (including Winter Storm Uri 2021)
- ‚ùå No load forecasts from 2019-2021
- ‚ùå No solar data from 2019-2021

**Impact on Models:**
- **Spike Model:** Already trained ‚úì (used existing 2019-2025 price data)
- **DA+RT Forecaster:** Can train NOW with existing price data ‚úì
- **Missing features:** ORDC, load forecasts, solar would ADD accuracy but aren't required

## üéØ WHAT YOU NEED (Critical for Better Models)

### HIGH PRIORITY - Historical ORDC Data ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```
Dataset: Real-Time_ORDC_and_Reliability_Deployment_Price_Adders_and_Reserves_by_SCED_Interval
Years Needed: 2019-2024 (especially 2021 for Winter Storm Uri)
Why Critical: ORDC is THE driver of price spikes in ERCOT
Current Gap: Only have 2024-2025

Files to copy:
  - All ORDC files from 2019
  - All ORDC files from 2020
  - All ORDC files from 2021 (Winter Storm Uri - MOST IMPORTANT)
  - All ORDC files from 2022
  - All ORDC files from 2023
```

**Estimated size:** ~200-300M per year = ~1-1.5GB total

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Historical Load Forecasts ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```
Dataset: Seven-Day_Load_Forecast_by_Model_and_Weather_Zone
Years Needed: 2019-2024
Why Important: Needed for accurate DA price forecasting
Current Gap: Only have 2024-2025

Estimated size: ~500M-1G per year = ~2-5GB total
```

### LOWER PRIORITY - Solar/Demand ‚≠ê‚≠ê
```
Datasets: Solar_Power_Production, System-Wide_Demand
Years Needed: 2019-2024
Why Helpful: Improves model accuracy, not critical
Current Gap: Only have 2024-2025

Estimated size: ~2-3GB total
```

## üí° RECOMMENDATION

### Option A: Train Models NOW (Recommended for Demo)
**Use existing price data (2010-2025) - READY NOW**

```bash
# You can train the Unified DA+RT model RIGHT NOW
cd /home/enrico/projects/power_market_pipeline

nohup uv run python ai_forecasting/train_unified_da_rt_quantile.py \
    > logs/unified_training_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M).log 2>&1 &
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Can start training immediately
- ‚úÖ Will complete by ~2 PM (3 hours)
- ‚úÖ Have enough data for good model (RT/DA/AS prices)
- ‚úÖ Guarantees models ready for Friday demo

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Missing ORDC features (would improve spike prediction)
- ‚ùå Missing load forecast features (would improve DA forecasting)

**Expected Performance:**
- DA MAE: $10-15/MWh (vs $7-10 with full features)
- RT MAE: $12-18/MWh (vs $8-12 with full features)
- Still impressive for demo!

---

### Option B: Copy Historical ORDC First (If Fast Transfer Available)
**Only if you can transfer 2019-2021 ORDC quickly (<2 hours)**

Priority order:
1. **2021 ORDC data** (Winter Storm Uri - most valuable)
2. **2020 ORDC data**
3. **2019 ORDC data**
4. 2022-2023 ORDC (nice to have)

Then process and retrain:
```bash
# Process new ORDC data
uv run python ai_forecasting/prepare_ml_data.py

# Train with enhanced features
uv run python ai_forecasting/train_unified_da_rt_quantile.py
```

**Timeline:**
- Transfer 2019-2021 ORDC: ~2 hours (if fast method available)
- Process into parquet: ~30 min
- Train model: ~3 hours
- Total: ~5-6 hours (complete by ~5 PM)

---

## üìÅ EXISTING DATA READY FOR USE

### Master Training File (Already Built)
```
File: /pool/ssd8tb/data/iso/ERCOT/ercot_market_data/ERCOT_data/master_features_multihorizon_2019_2025.parquet
Size: 5.2M
Samples: 38,962 training samples
Features: 53 features
Date Range: 2019-2025
Status: ‚úÖ READY - This is what spike model used
```

**Contains:**
- RT prices (all hubs, 15-min)
- DA prices (all hubs, hourly)
- AS prices (all 5 products)
- Temporal features (hour, day, month, cyclical)
- Weather features (NASA POWER satellite data)
- Derived features (volatility, spreads, lags, rolling stats)

**Missing from this file:**
- ORDC reserves (critical for spikes)
- Load forecasts (critical for DA prices)
- Solar/wind data (helpful)

---

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### If You Want Models Ready by 2 PM (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Start training NOW with existing data
cd /home/enrico/projects/power_market_pipeline

nohup uv run python ai_forecasting/train_unified_da_rt_quantile.py \
    > logs/unified_training_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M).log 2>&1 &

# Monitor progress
tail -f logs/unified_training_*.log
```

**Expected completion:** ~2 PM
**Then:** Spend afternoon on dashboard integration

---

### If You Have Fast Transfer Method for Historical Data
**Tell me your fastest way to copy:**
1. **2021 ORDC files** (Winter Storm Uri year - MOST VALUABLE)
2. **2019-2020 ORDC files**

**Once transferred:**
```bash
# I'll help you process it quickly
uv run python ai_forecasting/prepare_ml_data.py
```

## üí° MY RECOMMENDATION

**Start training NOW with existing data.**

**Reasoning:**
1. You have 2.5 days until demo (Friday 1 PM)
2. You have excellent core data (RT/DA/AS 2010-2025)
3. Models will work and be impressive without ORDC
4. Risk of transfer delays could jeopardize demo
5. Can always retrain with more data after demo

**If** you have a super-fast way to get 2019-2021 ORDC (< 2 hours), **then** do that first.

**Otherwise:** Train now, integrate this afternoon, rehearse tomorrow.

## ‚ùì QUESTIONS FOR YOU

1. **Do you have a faster way to copy 2019-2021 ORDC data?**
   - If yes: What's the method and how long will it take?
   - If no: Let's start training with existing data

2. **Is the other computer still accessible?**
   - If yes: Can you prioritize 2021 ORDC (Winter Storm Uri year)?

3. **What's your priority?**
   - A: Models guaranteed ready for Friday (train now)
   - B: Best possible models (wait for data if < 2 hours)

**Tell me and I'll guide you through the next steps!**
