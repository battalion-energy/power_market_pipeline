  - Price statistics (MA, STD, volatility)
  - Price changes (15-min, 1-hour, 4-hour)
  - Price momentum
  - Temporal features (cyclical encoding)

- **Test**: 8,166 samples (15%) - Spike rate: 0.49%

### Spike Definition
A price spike occurs when ANY of the following conditions is met:
1. **Statistical**: Price > μ + 3σ (rolling 30-day)
2. **Economic**: Price > $1000/MWh

## Model Architecture

**Type**: Transformer-based sequence model
**Input**: 12 timesteps (1 hour of 5-min data) × 8 features
**Architecture**:
- Input projection: 8 → 512 dimensions
- Positional encoding
- Transformer encoder: 6 layers, 8 heads, 512 hidden dim
- Multi-head attention pooling
- Classifier: 512 → 256 → 128 → 64 → 1 (logits)

**Optimization**:
- Loss: Focal Loss (α=0.75, γ=2.0) for class imbalance
- Optimizer: AdamW with OneCycleLR scheduler
- Mixed Precision: FP16 (for RTX 4070 efficiency)
- Batch Size: 256
- Epochs: 50

---

## Training Progress

### Current Status (Epoch 10/50)
- **Train Loss**: 0.0171
- **Val Loss**: 0.0189
- **Val AUC**: 0.5000 (baseline - will improve)
- **Val F1**: 0.0000 (model still learning)

**Notes**:
- AUC of 0.5 is random guessing baseline - normal for early training
- With 1.36% spike rate, model needs time to learn patterns
- Model checkpoint saved when validation AUC improves

3. **Best model checkpoint** - Saved when val AUC improves

### SHORT TERM (After training)
4. **Evaluate on test set** - Final performance metrics
5. **Error analysis** - What spike patterns are missed?
6. **Feature importance** - Which features matter most?
7. **Threshold tuning** - Optimize precision/recall tradeoff

### MEDIUM TERM
8. **Add more features**:
   - Wind/solar forecast errors (from CSV parsing)
   - Load forecast errors
   - Weather extreme indicators
   - ORDC reserve metrics (when available)
9. **Train Models 1 & 2**:
   - Model 1: DA Price Forecasting (LSTM-Attention)
   - Model 2: RT Price Forecasting (TCN-LSTM)
10. **Historical backtesting**:
    - Winter Storm Uri (Feb 2021)
    - Summer heat waves (2023, 2024)
    - High-price events
