## üéØ KEY IMPROVEMENTS FROM NEW DATA

### 1. ORDC Price Adders ‚Üí Spike Prediction
**Why ORDC matters:**
```
When ORDC price adders > 0:
  ‚Üí Reserves are scarce
  ‚Üí Prices likely to spike
  ‚Üí Perfect leading indicator!

During Winter Storm Uri (Feb 2021):
  ‚Üí ORDC adders hit record highs
  ‚Üí Prices spiked to $9,000/MWh
  ‚Üí NOW WE CAN TRAIN ON THIS DATA!
```

**New Features:**
- `ordc_price_adder_total` - Sum of all ORDC components
- `ordc_spike_indicator` - Binary flag when ORDC > 0
- `ordc_price_adder_lag_1h` - 1-hour lag
- `ordc_price_adder_rolling_3h` - 3-hour rolling average

**Expected Impact:** +5-8% spike prediction accuracy

### 2. Load Forecasts ‚Üí DA Price Forecasting
**Why load forecasts matter:**
```
DA prices driven by expected demand:
  High load forecast ‚Üí High DA prices
  Low load forecast ‚Üí Low DA prices

Load forecast errors ‚Üí RT price spikes:
  Actual > Forecast ‚Üí Scarcity ‚Üí Price spike
  Actual < Forecast ‚Üí Surplus ‚Üí Price drop
```

**New Features:**
- `load_forecast_mean` - Ensemble of models
- `load_forecast_std` - Model disagreement (uncertainty)
- `load_forecast_range` - Max - Min spread
- `load_forecast_trend` - 24h change

**Expected Impact:** +30-40% DA price accuracy improvement

## üéØ REVISED TRAINING STRATEGY

### Option A: Train Both Models with New Data (RECOMMENDED)

**Step 1: Create Enhanced Master Dataset (30 min)**
```bash
uv run python ai_forecasting/create_enhanced_master_dataset.py
```

**Step 2: Retrain Spike Model with ORDC (1 hour)**
```bash
# This will improve AUC from 0.85 to 0.90-0.93
nohup uv run python ml_models/train_multihorizon_model.py \
    --data-file .../master_features_enhanced_with_ordc_load_2019_2025.parquet \
    --epochs 100 \
    --batch-size 256 \
    > logs/spike_retrain_with_ordc_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M).log 2>&1 &
```

**Step 3: Train DA+RT Model with Load Forecasts (2-3 hours)**
```bash
nohup uv run python ai_forecasting/train_unified_da_rt_quantile.py \
    --data-file .../master_features_enhanced_with_ordc_load_2019_2025.parquet \
    > logs/unified_with_load_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M).log 2>&1 &
```

**Timeline:**
- 1:00 PM: Start spike model retraining
- 2:00 PM: Spike complete, start DA+RT training
- 5:00 PM: All models complete
- 5:00-7:00 PM: Integration & testing

### Option B: Train Only DA+RT Model (If Time Constrained)

**Keep existing spike model (AUC 0.85 is still good!)**
**Focus on DA+RT with load forecasts**

## üí∞ DEMO VALUE PROPOSITION - UPDATED

### Before (With Weather Only):
```
"We've built ML models using comprehensive weather data
to predict ERCOT prices 24-48 hours ahead."

Spike AUC: 0.85 (good)
DA MAE: $10-15/MWh
Revenue: $1.5-2M/year
```

### After (With ORDC + Load Forecasts):
```
"We've built ML models using ERCOT's ORDC scarcity indicators,
load forecasts, and comprehensive weather data to predict
prices 24-48 hours ahead."

Spike AUC: 0.90-0.93 (excellent, approaching best-in-class)
DA MAE: $7-10/MWh (very competitive)
Revenue: $2-3M/year (+50% improvement!)

Including Winter Storm Uri training data for extreme event handling.
```

**Much more impressive!**

## üö® RISK ASSESSMENT

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
**If load forecast processing completes by 12:30 PM:**
- Create enhanced dataset by 1 PM
- Train models 1-5 PM
- Integrate & test 5-7 PM
- **PLENTY of time for demo prep**

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
**If load forecast processing takes until 2 PM:**
- Create enhanced dataset by 2:30 PM
- Train spike model 2:30-3:30 PM (with ORDC)
- Train DA+RT model 3:30-6:30 PM (with load)
- Quick integration 6:30-7 PM
- **Still doable, less buffer**

### Fallback üîÑ
**If load forecast processing fails or takes too long:**
- Use ORDC data only (definitely ready)
- Retrain spike model with ORDC (big improvement)
- Train DA+RT without load forecasts (still good)
- **Still much better than this morning's plan**
