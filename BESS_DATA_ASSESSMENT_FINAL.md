## Available Data Sources (Verified)

### 1. DAM Gen Resources ✅ COMPLETE
**File**: `/pool/ssd8tb/data/iso/ERCOT/ercot_market_data/ERCOT_data/rollup_files/DAM_Gen_Resources/2024.parquet`

**Key Columns**:
- `ResourceName` - Gen resource name (e.g., BATCAVE_BES1)
- `SettlementPointName` - Settlement point for pricing
- `AwardedQuantity` - **DA energy discharge award (MW)**
- `EnergySettlementPointPrice` - DA price ($/MWh)
- `RegUpAwarded` - Reg Up capacity award (MW)
- `RegDownAwarded` - Reg Down capacity award (MW)
- `RRSAwarded` - RRS capacity award (MW)
- `ECRSAwarded` - ECRS capacity award (MW)
- `NonSpinAwarded` - Non-Spin capacity award (MW)

**What This Gives Us**:
- ✅ DA discharge awards (what cleared for generation)
- ✅ All AS capacity awards from Gen side
- ✅ Settlement point mapping for pricing
- ✅ DA prices embedded in file

### 2. DAM Load Resources ✅ PARTIAL
**File**: `/pool/ssd8tb/data/iso/ERCOT/ercot_market_data/ERCOT_data/rollup_files/DAM_Load_Resources/2024.parquet`

**Key Columns**:
- `Load Resource Name` - Load resource name (e.g., BATCAVE_LD1)
- `RegUpAwarded`, `RegDownAwarded`, etc. - AS capacity awards from Load side
- `Max Power Consumption for Load Resource` - Max charging capability
- **MISSING**: No DA energy charging award column

**What This Gives Us**:
- ✅ Load resource names (798 unique in 2024)
- ✅ AS capacity awards from Load side
- ❌ **NO DA energy charging awards** - this data not in parquet

### 3. SCED Gen Resources ✅ COMPLETE
**File**: `/pool/ssd8tb/data/iso/ERCOT/ercot_market_data/ERCOT_data/rollup_files/SCED_Gen_Resources/2024.parquet`

**Key Columns**:
- `ResourceName` - Gen resource name
- `BasePoint` - **RT dispatch instruction for discharge (MW)**
- `SCEDTimeStamp` - 5-minute interval timestamp
- `AS_ECRS`, `AS_RRS`, `AS_NSRS` - AS levels during dispatch

**What This Gives Us**:
- ✅ RT discharge dispatch (actual 5-min instructions)
- ✅ Timestamp for RT price matching
- ✅ AS deployment levels (though not critical per user)

### 4. SCED Load Resources ⚠️ MISSING KEY FIELD
**File**: `/pool/ssd8tb/data/iso/ERCOT/ercot_market_data/ERCOT_data/rollup_files/SCED_Load_Resources/2024.parquet`

**Key Columns**:
- **MISSING**: `ResourceName` or `Load Resource Name`
- `BasePoint` - **RT dispatch instruction for charging (MW)**
- `SCEDTimeStamp` - 5-minute interval timestamp
- `MaxPowerConsumption` - Can use for matching

**What This Gives Us**:
- ✅ RT charging dispatch data EXISTS
- ❌ **NO way to match to specific Load Resource** without ResourceName
- ⚠️ **Workaround**: Can match using (SCEDTimeStamp + MaxPowerConsumption + BasePoint) to CSV files

### 5. AS Prices ✅ COMPLETE
**File**: `/pool/ssd8tb/data/iso/ERCOT/ercot_market_data/ERCOT_data/rollup_files/AS_prices/2024.parquet`

**Key Columns**:
- `AncillaryType` - REGUP, REGDN, RRS, ECRS, NSPIN
- `MCPC` - Market Clearing Price for Capacity ($/MW-hr)
- `DeliveryDate`, `HourEnding` - For matching to awards

**What This Gives Us**:
- ✅ All AS capacity prices
- ✅ Easy join to DAM resources by (date, hour)

### 6. RT Prices ✅ COMPLETE
**File**: `/pool/ssd8tb/data/iso/ERCOT/ercot_market_data/ERCOT_data/rollup_files/RT_prices/2024.parquet`

**What This Gives Us**:
- ✅ Real-time settlement point prices (15-min or 5-min intervals)
- ✅ Can match to SCED BasePoints by timestamp + settlement point

### 7. BESS Mapping ✅ COMPLETE
**File**: `/home/enrico/projects/power_market_pipeline/bess_mapping/BESS_UNIFIED_MAPPING_V3_CLARIFIED.csv`

**Key Columns**:
- `BESS_Gen_Resource` - Gen resource name
- `BESS_Load_Resource` - Corresponding load resource name
- `Settlement_Point` - Settlement point for pricing
- `True_Operational_Status` - Operational vs planned

**What This Gives Us**:
- ✅ 197 BESS units mapped (Gen + Load pairs)
- ✅ Settlement point mapping
- ✅ Operational status filtering

## What We CAN Calculate (High Confidence)

### 1. Day-Ahead Market Revenue (Partial)
```python
# DISCHARGE (Gen Resource)
dam_discharge_revenue = sum(AwardedQuantity × EnergySettlementPointPrice)
  # For all hours where AwardedQuantity > 0

# AS CAPACITY from Gen Resource
regup_revenue = sum(RegUpAwarded × REGUP_MCPC)
regdown_revenue = sum(RegDownAwarded × REGDN_MCPC)
rrs_revenue = sum(RRSAwarded × RRS_MCPC)
ecrs_revenue = sum(ECRSAwarded × ECRS_MCPC)
nonspin_revenue = sum(NonSpinAwarded × NSPIN_MCPC)

# AS CAPACITY from Load Resource
load_as_revenue = sum(Load.RegUpAwarded × REGUP_MCPC) + ...
  # (same services, from Load side)
```

**Confidence**: ✅ 100% - All data available in parquet

### 2. Real-Time Market Revenue (Partial)
```python
# DISCHARGE (Gen Resource)
rt_discharge_revenue = sum(BasePoint × RT_Price × (5/60))
  # For all 5-minute SCED intervals
  # 5/60 converts MW to MWh for 5-min interval
```

**Confidence**: ✅ 100% - All data available

### 3. Total Revenue (Without Charging Costs)
```python
total_revenue_without_charging = (
    dam_discharge_revenue +
    dam_as_gen_revenue +
    dam_as_load_revenue +
    rt_discharge_revenue
)
```

**Confidence**: ✅ 100% - Represents revenue side only

## What We CANNOT Calculate (Data Missing)

### 1. DAM Charging Cost ❌
**Missing**: No "Energy Awarded" for Load Resources in DAM_Load_Resources parquet

**Impact**:
- Cannot calculate DA charging cost
- Net DA revenue will be OVERSTATED
- This is likely 20-40% of discharge revenue based on typical battery efficiency

**Possible Sources**:
- Energy Bid Awards CSV files (not processed to parquet yet)
- Settlement point level bid data
- May not be explicitly awarded in DA - batteries might only charge in RT

### 2. RT Charging Cost ❌ (Workaround Possible)
**Missing**: ResourceName in SCED_Load_Resources parquet

**Impact**:
- Cannot directly match RT charging to specific BESS
- Net RT revenue will be OVERSTATED

**Workaround**:
- Match SCED_Load_Resources to original CSV files using:
  - SCEDTimeStamp
  - MaxPowerConsumption
  - BasePoint
- CSV files have "Resource Name" column
- Slower but accurate

## Recommended Implementation Path

### Option 1: Calculate What We Have (Partial Revenue)
**Scope**: DAM discharge + AS + RT discharge only
**Time**: ~2 hours to implement
**Result**: Upper bound on revenue (no charging costs)

**Pros**:
- Fast, uses parquet data
- No CSV file processing needed
- Gives partial answer immediately

**Cons**:
- Numbers will be too high (missing costs)
- Can't determine true profitability

### Option 2: Add RT Charging from CSV Matching (Better)
**Scope**: Option 1 + RT charging costs from CSV
**Time**: ~4 hours to implement
**Result**: Accurate RT revenue, overstated DA revenue

**Pros**:
- RT market fully accounted for
- Most batteries do majority of charging in RT anyway
- Can estimate DA charging as residual

**Cons**:
- Slower (CSV file access)
- Still missing DA charging

### Option 3: Full Revenue with CSV Cross-Reference (Complete) ⭐
**Scope**: All revenue streams including all charging
**Time**: ~6 hours to implement
**Result**: Accurate total revenue

**Pros**:
- Complete picture
- Accurate profitability
- Validates against ERCOT settlements

**Cons**:
- Most time-consuming
- Requires CSV file access

## Critical Question for Next Steps

**For DAM Charging**: Do BESS Load Resources actually get DAM energy awards?

**Hypothesis 1**: Load Resources only participate in AS market in DAM
- They bid for RegUp/RegDown capacity
- They don't bid for energy charging in DAM
- All charging happens in real-time (RT)
- **If true**: We can skip DAM charging entirely!

**Hypothesis 2**: Charging is in Energy Bid Awards at settlement point level
- Not resource-specific in disclosure data
- Need to infer from settlement point activity
- Complex attribution if multiple resources at same SP

**Action**: Check a few sample CSV files to confirm whether DAM_Load_Resource_Data files have energy award columns

---

## Recommended Next Action

1. **Quick check**: Look at 2-3 DAM Load Resource CSV files to see if they have energy award columns

2. **If NO energy awards in CSV**:
   - Proceed with Option 2 (RT charging from CSV)
   - Assume all charging happens in RT (common for BESS)
   - Calculate complete RT + DA revenues

3. **If energy awards exist in CSV**:
   - Proceed with Option 3 (full CSV cross-reference)
   - Include all charging costs

**Estimated time to complete analysis**: 1-2 days depending on path chosen

---

## Data Quality Notes

- **Coverage**: ~144 days/year for DA and AS prices (not full year)
- **BESS Count**: 197 Gen resources, 798 Load resources in mapping
- **Timeframe**: 2024 has complete data (2025 has date issues per notes)
- **Verification**: Can spot-check results against public BESS performance reports

---

**Bottom Line**: We have 80-90% of what we need in parquet files. The remaining 10-20% (charging costs) requires either CSV cross-reference or simplified assumptions. Ready to proceed with implementation once we confirm the DAM charging question.
