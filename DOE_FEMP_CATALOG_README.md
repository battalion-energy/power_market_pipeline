## Usage Guidelines

### For Battery Optimization

**Step 1: Filter by Geography**
```python
# Find programs in specific state
programs = [p for p in dr_programs if 'California' in p['states']]
```

**Step 2: Check Customer Class Eligibility**
```python
# Find programs for commercial customers
eligible = [p for p in programs
            if p['eligibility']['customer_classes']['commercial']]
```

**Step 3: Review Payment Structure**
```python
# Find programs with performance payments
perf_pay = [p for p in eligible
            if p['payment_structure']['has_performance_payment']]
```

**Step 4: Visit Program URL for Details**
```python
# Get authoritative details from utility
program_url = p['data_sources']['program_url']
# Manual review required for detailed parameters
```

### For Rate Analysis

**Step 1: Filter by Rate Type**
```python
# Find all TOU rates in state
tou_rates = rate_programs['programs_by_type']['TOU']
state_tou = [r for r in tou_rates if r['state'] == 'California']
```

**Step 2: Review Descriptions**
```python
# Descriptions contain rate structure hints
print(rate['rate_structure_notes'])
```

**Step 3: Visit Utility Tariff Page**
```python
# Get exact rates from tariff
tariff_url = rate['program_url']
```

## Next Steps for Complete Data

To achieve world-class data quality for energy optimization, the following research is needed for each program:

### Phase 1: Program Page Scraping (Automated)
- [ ] Fetch each program's detail page (474 pages)
- [ ] Extract tariff sheets and program rules PDFs
- [ ] Parse structured data from program pages
- [ ] Extract rate tables where available

### Phase 2: Detailed Manual Research (Per Program)
For each of 122 DR programs, research and verify:
- [ ] Exact capacity and performance payment rates
- [ ] Maximum events per season/year
- [ ] Event duration parameters (min/typical/max)
- [ ] Notification requirements (hours of notice)
- [ ] Event triggers (temperature, price, grid condition thresholds)
- [ ] Penalty structures
- [ ] Historical event data (dates, times, durations for past 3-5 years)
- [ ] Customer eligibility (exact kW thresholds)
- [ ] Nomination/enrollment deadlines and procedures

For each of 352 rate programs, research and verify:
- [ ] Exact on-peak/off-peak hours by season
- [ ] Rate amounts ($/kWh) for each period
- [ ] Demand charges ($/kW)
- [ ] Customer class eligibility and kW thresholds
- [ ] Minimum contract terms
- [ ] Special provisions (holidays, weekends, critical peak events)

### Phase 3: Continuous Updates
- [ ] Monitor utility websites for rate changes (quarterly)
- [ ] Track program openings/closings
- [ ] Update historical event data
- [ ] Add new programs as utilities launch them

### Phase 4: Validation
- [ ] Cross-reference with utility regulatory filings
- [ ] Verify with utility representatives
- [ ] Test enrollment processes
- [ ] Validate payment calculations with actual bills

## Known Limitations

1. **Temporal Accuracy**: Data scraped 2025-10-11. Rates and programs change.
2. **Description Parsing**: Automated extraction may miss nuances in text
3. **Missing Rate Details**: Most programs require tariff sheet review for exact rates
4. **Historical Events**: Very few programs publish event history publicly
5. **API Access**: API availability not documented in DOE database
6. **Aggregator Requirements**: Not always clear which programs allow direct enrollment
7. **Size Thresholds**: kW minimums often require contacting utility
