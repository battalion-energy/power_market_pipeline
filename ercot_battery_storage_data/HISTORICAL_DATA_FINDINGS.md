# Historical BESS Data Research - Findings

## Summary

**Key Finding**: Historical Fuel Mix Reports from ERCOT (2007-2024) **do not include Power Storage** as a separate fuel category. Battery storage tracking in ERCOT's public APIs and reports is relatively recent, starting around 2023-2024.

## Data Sources Investigated

### 1. Energy Storage Resources API ✅ (Currently Using)
**URL**: `https://www.ercot.com/api/1/services/read/dashboards/energy-storage-resources.json`

**Coverage**: Rolling 48-hour window (previous day + current day)
**Resolution**: 5-minute intervals
**Data Quality**: Excellent - provides separate charging/discharging values

**Fields**:
- `totalCharging`: MW charging (negative values)
- `totalDischarging`: MW discharging (positive values)
- `netOutput`: Net MW output

**Status**: ✅ Operational with automated collection since Oct 11, 2025 (currently collecting gap-free data)

### 2. Fuel Mix API (Alternative)
**URL**: `https://www.ercot.com/api/1/services/read/dashboards/fuel-mix.json`

**Coverage**: ~38 hours (similar to Energy Storage Resources API)
**Resolution**: 5-minute intervals
**Data Quality**: Good - but only shows net generation (no charging/discharging separation)

**Fields**:
- `Power Storage.gen`: Net generation (MW) - always positive

**Limitation**: Less detailed than Energy Storage Resources API (no charging/discharging breakdown)

### 3. Historical Fuel Mix Reports ❌ (No Power Storage Data)
**Source**: https://www.ercot.com/gridinfo/generation

**Files Downloaded**:
- `FuelMixReport_PreviousYears.zip` (49 MB) - Contains 2007-2024 annual reports
- `IntGenbyFuel2025.xlsx` (2.2 MB) - Current year report

**Coverage**: 2007-2024 (complete historical archive)
**Resolution**: 15-minute intervals

**Fuel Types Included**:
- Biomass
- Coal
- Gas
- Gas-CC
- Hydro
- Nuclear
- Other
- Solar
- Wind
- WSL (Wind-powered Steam-electric + Landfill gas)

**Fuel Types NOT Included**:
- ❌ Power Storage
- ❌ Battery Storage
- ❌ BESS

**Conclusion**: These reports were created before battery storage became a significant part of ERCOT's grid mix. Battery tracking was added to public APIs in 2023-2024 when BESS deployment accelerated.

## Historical Context

### ERCOT Battery Storage Timeline

**Pre-2021**: Minimal battery storage deployment
- Battery capacity: <100 MW
- Not tracked separately in public reports

**2022-2023**: Rapid deployment begins
- Battery capacity grows to ~3-5 GW
- ERCOT begins tracking as separate category
- Public APIs start including Power Storage data

**2024**: Explosive growth
- Battery capacity: ~10-12 GW
- Monthly Capacity (as of Oct 2025): **14,077 MW**
- Significant impact on grid operations and pricing

**2025**: Continued expansion
- Current capacity: **14+ GW**
- Real-time APIs provide detailed operational data

## Available Historical Data

### What We Have ✅

**Current**: 37.7 hours of gap-free data (Oct 10, 2025 00:00 - Oct 11, 2025 13:40)
- Source: Energy Storage Resources API
- File: `ercot_battery_storage_data/bess_catalog.csv`
- Records: 453
- Resolution: 5-minute intervals
- Quality: 100% complete, no gaps

**Automated Collection**: Running since Oct 11, 2025
- Cron job executes every 5 minutes
- Continuous gap-free collection
- Log file: `ercot_battery_storage_data/bess_updater.log`

### What We Don't Have ❌

**Historical data before Oct 10, 2025**:
- Energy Storage Resources API only provides rolling 48-hour window
- Historical reports don't include Power Storage category
- No public archive of historical BESS operational data found

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Continue Current Collection (Recommended)
**Pros**:
- Already operational and working perfectly
- Will build historical archive going forward
- Gap-free guarantee
- No additional work needed

**Cons**:
- No historical data before Oct 10, 2025
- Must wait to accumulate history

**Timeline**: After 1 year of collection (Oct 2026), will have complete 365-day dataset

### Option 2: Request Historical Data from ERCOT
**Potential Sources**:
1. **ERCOT Data Portal** (https://data.ercot.com)
   - Requires account registration
   - May have historical BESS operational data
   - Access level: Unknown (free vs. subscription)

2. **ERCOT Market Reports**
   - 60-day disclosure reports
   - Settlement point pricing data
   - May include BESS resource-specific data

3. **Direct Data Request**
   - Contact ERCOT Data team
   - Request historical Power Storage generation data
   - Response time: Unknown

### Option 3: Third-Party Data Sources
**gridstatus.io**:
- Provides historical BESS data
- API access available
- May require subscription

**EIA (Energy Information Administration)**:
- Form EIA-930 data
- Hourly electricity operating data
- May include BESS data for ERCOT region

## Current Data Characteristics

From the 37.7 hours of data collected (Oct 10-11, 2025):

**Capacity Utilization**:
- Peak discharge: 8,509 MW (at 2025-10-10 18:40 - evening peak)
- Peak charge: -6,107 MW (at 2025-10-10 10:20 - midday solar peak)
- Average net output: -513.55 MW (net charging during collection period)

**Operational Pattern**:
- **Morning**: Transition from charging to discharging (06:00-09:00)
- **Midday**: Heavy charging (-5,000 to -6,000 MW) during solar peak (09:00-17:00)
- **Evening**: Maximum discharging (+6,000 to +9,000 MW) during demand peak (17:00-21:00)
- **Night**: Moderate charging (-600 to -800 MW) during low prices (00:00-06:00)

   - Use: Reference for other fuel types (not BESS)

3. **Individual Annual Files** (IntGenByFuel2007.xls through IntGenbyFuel2024.xlsx)
   - Location: `ercot_battery_storage_data/historical_fuel_mix/`
   - Format: Excel (.xls and .xlsx)
   - Status: Extracted and analyzed
   - Result: No Power Storage data found in any year

## Conclusion

**For Historical BESS Data**: The historical Fuel Mix Reports do not contain Power Storage data. Battery storage tracking in ERCOT's public APIs is relatively recent (2023-2024 onwards).

**Best Path Forward**: Continue automated collection with the existing cron job system. After sufficient time (months to years), you will have a comprehensive historical dataset. For data before Oct 2025, consider:
1. ERCOT Data Portal registration
2. Third-party data sources (gridstatus.io, EIA)
3. Direct request to ERCOT

**Current System Status**: ✅ Operational and collecting gap-free data
