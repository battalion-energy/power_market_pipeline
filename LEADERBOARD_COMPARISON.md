## Key Changes in Rankings

### Winners (Least Impacted)
1. **BATCAVE_BES1**: Maintains #1 position despite highest charging costs ($225K)
   - Strong DAM arbitrage overcomes charging costs
   - High AS revenue provides cushion

2. **AZURE_BESS1**: Only 4.4% revenue reduction
   - Minimal charging costs due to limited operations

### Losers (Most Impacted)
1. **ANCHOR_BESS2**: 87.5% revenue reduction
   - High charging costs relative to discharge revenue
   - Moves from profitable to barely profitable

2. **BELD_BELU1**: Flips from $72K profit to $42K loss
   - Charging costs exceed discharge revenue
   - Completely dependent on AS for any revenue

3. **BAY_CITY_BESS**: 175% impact (was marginally profitable, now loss-making)
   - $107K in charging costs discovered
   - Poor DAM arbitrage performance

## Statistical Impact

### Fleet-Wide Metrics
| Metric | Old Method | New Method | Change |
|--------|------------|------------|---------|
| Total Revenue | $3,766,287 | $2,963,496 | -21.3% |
| Average per BESS | $376,629 | $296,350 | -21.3% |
| Profitable Units | 8/10 | 6/10 | -20% |
| Units with Positive DAM | 10/10 | 2/10 | -80% |

### Charging Cost Distribution
- **Average**: $80,279 per BESS
- **Median**: $68,581 per BESS
- **Maximum**: $225,147 (BATCAVE_BES1)
- **Minimum**: $8,318 (AZURE_BESS1)

## Key Insights

### 1. Reality Check
The new method provides a **realistic view** of BESS economics:
- Charging costs are substantial (21% of gross revenue)
- Only 2 units achieve profitable DAM arbitrage after charging costs
- AS revenue is critical for profitability

### 2. Risk Exposure
With charging costs included, the risk profile becomes clear:
- **91.5%** of net revenue from AS (was 72% before)
- **4 units** have >80% AS dependency
- **6 units** would be unprofitable without AS

### 3. Operational Excellence Matters
The gap between top and bottom performers widens:
- BATCAVE_BES1: Profitable despite highest charging costs (efficient operations)
- Others: Charging costs exceed margins (poor optimization)

## Recommendations

### For BESS Operators
1. **Optimize Charging Strategy**: Focus on lowest-price hours
2. **Improve Round-Trip Efficiency**: Currently implied 24% is very low
3. **Diversify Revenue**: Over-reliance on AS is risky

### For Investors
1. **Due Diligence**: Ensure charging costs are included in pro formas
2. **Location Matters**: Settlement point impacts profitability
3. **Scale Benefits**: Larger units like BATCAVE show better economics

### For Market Analysis
1. **Always Include Charging**: Old method overstates revenue by 21%
2. **Check Energy Balance**: Discharge must equal charge × efficiency
3. **Monitor AS Markets**: Critical for current BESS profitability

## Conclusion

The corrected leaderboard reveals the **true economics** of BESS in ERCOT:
- ✅ Charging costs are material (~$800K for 10 units)
- ✅ DAM arbitrage is harder than it appears
- ✅ AS revenue is the primary profit driver
- ✅ Operational excellence separates winners from losers

The old leaderboard was **overly optimistic** by ignoring charging costs. The new leaderboard provides **realistic guidance** for investment and operational decisions.
