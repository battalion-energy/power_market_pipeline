"""SPP (Southwest Power Pool) downloader using standardized schema.

CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENT WARNING
================================
This downloader is a SKELETON implementation. SPP requires digital certificates
for API access, which can take 2-4 weeks to obtain from SPP Customer Relations.

Contact Information:
- Phone: (501) 614-3200
- Process: Contact customer relations rep with certificate request
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks for approval and certificate issuance

Alternative: Use gridstatus.io library while waiting for certificates.

# Implementation roadmap when certificates are obtained:
#
# 1. Certificate Setup:
#    - Store certificate in secure location
#    - Set SPP_CERT_PATH environment variable
#    - Test certificate with simple API call
#
# 2. Implement _download_with_certificate():
#    - Create SSL context with client certificate
#    - Configure aiohttp session with SSL
#    - Add retry logic for network failures
#    - Handle certificate expiration gracefully
#
# 3. Implement download_lmp():
#    - Map market types (DAM/RTBM) to endpoints
#    - Handle both location-based and bus-based queries
#    - Parse SPP's CSV/JSON response format
#    - Save to standardized CSV structure
#    - Track downloaded files to avoid duplicates
#
# 4. Implement download_ancillary_services():
#    - Query /pages/operating-reserves endpoint
#    - Parse regulation, spinning, supplemental products
#    - Map SPP product names to standardized schema
#    - Handle co-optimized market data structure
#
# 5. Implement download_load():
#    - Identify SPP load data endpoints from API docs
#    - Download actual and forecast load
#    - Standardize to common load schema
#
# 6. Implement get_available_locations():
#    - Query SPP for available settlement points
#    - Cache location list (changes infrequently)
#    - Classify locations (hub/zone/interface/bus)
#    - Store in database Location table
#
# 7. Testing:
#    - Test with small date ranges (1-7 days)
#    - Verify data format matches standardized schema
#    - Check for missing data or gaps
#    - Validate prices against SPP website
#
# 8. Production:
#    - Run historical backfill (2019-2025)
#    - Set up scheduled downloads
#    - Monitor for certificate expiration
#    - Handle API version changes
