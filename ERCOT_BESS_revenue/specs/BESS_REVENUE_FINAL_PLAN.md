# BESS Revenue Analysis - Final Implementation Plan

**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Critical Finding**: Load Resources do NOT receive DAM energy awards - only AS capacity awards
**Status**: Ready to implement

---

## üéØ Key Discovery: No DAM Charging Awards

After checking both parquet and CSV source files, **confirmed**:

**DAM Load Resource Data contains**:
- ‚úÖ RegUp Awarded, RegDown Awarded
- ‚úÖ RRS Awarded (PFR, FFR, UFR components)
- ‚úÖ ECRS Awarded (SD, MD components)
- ‚úÖ NonSpin Awarded
- ‚ùå **NO energy charging award column**

**Implication**: BESS Load Resources only participate in Ancillary Services in DAM, not energy market. **All charging happens in Real-Time market**.

## Revenue Calculation - Simplified Formula

### Day-Ahead Market (Hourly)
```
For each Gen Resource (e.g., BATCAVE_BES1):

  DAM Discharge Revenue = Œ£(AwardedQuantity √ó EnergySettlementPointPrice)

  DAM AS Revenue (Gen side) =
    Œ£(RegUpAwarded √ó REGUP_MCPC) +
    Œ£(RegDownAwarded √ó REGDN_MCPC) +
    Œ£(RRSAwarded √ó RRS_MCPC) +
    Œ£(ECRSAwarded √ó ECRS_MCPC) +
    Œ£(NonSpinAwarded √ó NSPIN_MCPC)

For each Load Resource (e.g., BATCAVE_LD1):

  DAM AS Revenue (Load side) =
    Œ£(RegUpAwarded √ó REGUP_MCPC) +
    Œ£(RegDownAwarded √ó REGDN_MCPC) +
    Œ£(RRSAwarded √ó RRS_MCPC) +
    Œ£(ECRSAwarded √ó ECRS_MCPC) +
    Œ£(NonSpinAwarded √ó NSPIN_MCPC)

  DAM Charge Cost = 0  (no DA energy charging)
```

### Real-Time Market (5-minute intervals)
```
For each Gen Resource:

  RT Discharge Revenue = Œ£(BasePoint √ó RT_Price √ó (5/60))
    # BasePoint in MW, RT_Price in $/MWh
    # 5/60 converts 5-min interval to hours

For each Load Resource:

  RT Charge Cost = Œ£(BasePoint √ó RT_Price √ó (5/60))
    # Same formula but this is a cost (subtracted from revenue)
```

### Total Revenue
```
Total Revenue =
  DAM_discharge_revenue +
  DAM_AS_revenue_gen +
  DAM_AS_revenue_load +
  RT_discharge_revenue -
  RT_charge_cost
```

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Calculate Revenues We Can Get Easily (90% of total)
**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Uses**: Parquet data only

Calculate:
- ‚úÖ DAM discharge revenue (Gen)
- ‚úÖ DAM AS revenue (Gen + Load)
- ‚úÖ RT discharge revenue (Gen)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è RT charge cost = 0 (temporarily excluded)

**Result**: Revenue UPPER BOUND (overestimated because missing RT charging costs)

### Phase 2: Add RT Charging via CSV Matching (Complete Picture)
**Time**: +2-3 hours
**Uses**: Parquet + CSV cross-reference

Add:
- ‚úÖ RT charge cost (Load) via CSV matching

**Result**: ACCURATE total revenue

---

## Revenue Components (Estimated % of Total)

Based on previous BESS analysis and market structure:

| Component | Typical % | Complexity | Data Available |
|-----------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| DAM AS Revenue (Gen) | 50-70% | Low | ‚úÖ Parquet |
| DAM AS Revenue (Load) | 10-20% | Low | ‚úÖ Parquet |
| RT Discharge Revenue | 15-25% | Medium | ‚úÖ Parquet |
| DAM Discharge Revenue | 5-15% | Low | ‚úÖ Parquet |
| RT Charging Cost | -20 to -40% | Medium | ‚ö†Ô∏è CSV needed |

**Key Insight**: Ancillary Services = 60-90% of total revenue. Energy arbitrage is secondary.

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Step 1: Quick Win - Calculate AS + DA Revenue (TODAY)
```python
# Process all BESS units from mapping file
# For each unit:
#   1. Get Gen Resource data from DAM_Gen_Resources
#   2. Get Load Resource data from DAM_Load_Resources
#   3. Join AS prices by (date, hour, service type)
#   4. Calculate AS revenues
#   5. Calculate DA discharge revenue
# Output: BESS AS + DA leaderboard
```
**Time**: 2 hours
**Result**: 60-80% of total revenue calculated

### Step 2: Add RT Discharge (TOMORROW)
```python
# For each Gen Resource:
#   1. Get all SCED intervals from SCED_Gen_Resources
#   2. Join RT prices by (timestamp, settlement point)
#   3. Calculate RT discharge revenue
# Output: Updated leaderboard with RT revenues
```
**Time**: 1 hour
**Result**: 90% of total revenue calculated

### Step 3: Add RT Charging via CSV Matching (IF NEEDED)
```python
# For each Load Resource:
#   1. Load relevant SCED Load CSV files for date range
#   2. Filter by Load Resource Name
#   3. Join RT prices
#   4. Calculate RT charging cost
# Output: Complete revenue picture
```
**Time**: 3 hours
**Result**: 100% accurate revenue

## Example: BATCAVE_BES1 Revenue Calculation

### Input Data
- Gen Resource: BATCAVE_BES1
- Load Resource: BATCAVE_LD1
- Settlement Point: BATCAVE_RN
- Period: 2024 full year

### Expected Revenue Breakdown
```
DAM Discharge Revenue:        $500,000   (10%)
DAM AS Revenue (Gen):       $2,500,000   (50%)
DAM AS Revenue (Load):        $800,000   (16%)
RT Discharge Revenue:         $700,000   (14%)
RT Charging Cost:            -$500,000  (-10%)
                            -----------
Total Net Revenue:          $4,000,000  (100%)
```

### Calculation Steps
1. Load DAM_Gen_Resources for BATCAVE_BES1 ‚Üí get 8,760 hourly records
2. Load DAM_Load_Resources for BATCAVE_LD1 ‚Üí get 8,760 hourly records
3. Load AS_prices for 2024 ‚Üí pivot by AncillaryType
4. Calculate DAM revenues (discharge + AS)
5. Load SCED_Gen_Resources for BATCAVE_BES1 ‚Üí get ~1.75M 5-min records
6. Load RT_prices for BATCAVE_RN
7. Calculate RT discharge revenue
8. (Optional) Load SCED Load CSV, match BATCAVE_LD1, calculate RT charging cost

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] All 197 BESS units processed
- [ ] DAM revenue calculated for each (discharge + AS)
- [ ] RT discharge revenue calculated for each
- [ ] Leaderboard CSV generated
- [ ] Top 10 BESS identified by revenue
- [ ] Data quality checks passed (no negative AS revenues, reasonable totals)

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- [ ] RT charging costs added for all units
- [ ] Net revenue recalculated
- [ ] Results validated against known BESS performance
- [ ] Final leaderboard generated

---

## Data Quality Checks

1. **AS Revenue Sanity**:
   - RegUp + RegDown revenue should be 30-50% of total AS
   - No service should show negative revenue
   - Typical AS revenue: $100-500/MW-month

2. **Energy Revenue Sanity**:
   - DA discharge should correlate with high-price hours
   - RT discharge should be during scarcity events
   - Charging cost should be 60-80% of discharge revenue (efficiency)

3. **Totals Sanity**:
   - Total annual revenue per MW: $80,000 - $200,000/MW typical
   - BATCAVE_BES1 (155 MW) should be top performer
   - Units with no Load Resource should show zero charging cost

## Next Steps (Ordered by Priority)

1. **NOW**: Write Phase 1 calculator (AS + DA only) ‚Üí 2 hours
2. **NEXT**: Run on all 2024 BESS, generate leaderboard ‚Üí 1 hour
3. **REVIEW**: Validate top 10 results look reasonable
4. **THEN**: Decide if RT charging needed for your analysis
5. **OPTIONAL**: Add Phase 2 (RT charging) if required

## Questions Resolved

‚úÖ **Can we calculate BESS revenues?** Yes, with high confidence
‚úÖ **Do we need bid curves?** No, awards are already in the data
‚úÖ **Do Load Resources get DA energy awards?** No, only AS awards
‚úÖ **Where is RT charging data?** SCED_Load_Resources (needs CSV matching)
‚úÖ **What % of revenue can we calculate easily?** 90% (all except RT charging)

**READY TO IMPLEMENT**. Recommend starting with Phase 1 to get immediate results, then evaluate if Phase 2 needed based on your accuracy requirements.
