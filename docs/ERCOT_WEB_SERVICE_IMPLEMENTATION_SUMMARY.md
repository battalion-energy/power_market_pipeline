## Current Data Status

| Dataset | Last Data | Days Old | Action Needed |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Day-Ahead Prices | 2025-08-19 | 50 days | Download 50 days |
| Real-Time Prices | Invalid | - | Investigate & download |
| AS Prices | 2025-08-19 | 50 days | Download 50 days |
| 60d DAM Gen Resources | No timestamp | - | Download from Dec 2023 |
| 60d SCED Gen Resources | 2024-12-31 | 280 days | Download 280 days |
| 60d DAM Load Resources | No timestamp | - | Download from Dec 2023 |
| 60d SCED Load Resources | 2024-12-31 | 280 days | Download 280 days |

## Architecture Highlights

### Smart State Management
- JSON-based state file tracks last successful download per dataset
- Prevents re-downloading existing data
- Maintains download history for troubleshooting
- Automatic resume from last successful chunk

### Robust Error Handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects ERCOT's 30 req/min limit with configurable delays
- **Authentication**: Automatic token refresh (50min for 1-hour tokens)
- **Retries**: Exponential backoff (2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s → 60s max)
- **429 Handling**: Honors `Retry-After` header when rate limited
- **Gap Prevention**: State tracking ensures no missing data

### Optimized Performance
- **Chunked Downloads**: Configurable chunk sizes (1-30 days depending on data volume)
- **Pagination**: Automatic pagination with configurable page sizes
- **Async I/O**: Fully async for efficient network operations
- **Parallel Processing**: Can run multiple downloaders concurrently (future enhancement)

### Dataset-Specific Tuning

| Dataset | Chunk Size | Page Size | Notes |
|---------|------------|-----------|-------|
| DAM Prices | 30 days | 50,000 | Hourly data, ~36K records/month |
| RT Prices | 7 days | 50,000 | 5-min data, ~100K records/week |
| AS Prices | 30 days | 50,000 | Hourly data, moderate volume |
| 60d DAM Gen | 3 days | 10,000 | **HUGE** files, many columns |
| 60d SCED Gen | 1 day | 5,000 | **MASSIVE** files, 5-min intervals |

## What's Different from Old Approach

### Old (Selenium Scraping)
- ❌ Manual navigation of ERCOT website
- ❌ Download ZIP files, extract CSVs
- ❌ No automatic gap detection
- ❌ Brittle (breaks when website changes)
- ❌ Slow and resource-intensive
- ❌ No state tracking

### New (Web Service API)
- ✅ Direct API access with authentication
- ✅ Automatic JSON → CSV conversion
- ✅ Built-in gap detection and prevention
- ✅ Stable API with SLA guarantees
- ✅ Fast and efficient
- ✅ Comprehensive state tracking

## Integration with Existing Pipeline

### Current Workflow
1. ~~Selenium scraper downloads ZIPs~~ **→ REPLACED**
2. ~~Extract CSVs from ZIPs~~ **→ REPLACED**
3. Rust processor converts CSVs → Parquet ✅ **KEEP**
4. BESS revenue analysis uses Parquet ✅ **KEEP**

### New Workflow
1. **Web Service API downloads to CSV** ← NEW
2. **Gap verification** ← NEW
3. Rust processor converts CSVs → Parquet ✅ **EXISTING**
4. BESS revenue analysis uses Parquet ✅ **EXISTING**

## Critical Datasets for BESS Revenue

The system prioritizes these datasets (in order):

1. **Priority 1: DAM Prices** - Settlement point prices for energy arbitrage
2. **Priority 2: RT Prices** - Real-time LMPs for dispatch optimization
3. **Priority 3: AS Prices** - Reg Up/Down, Reserves for ancillary revenue
4. **Priority 4: 60d DAM Gen Resources** - **CRITICAL!** DAM awards, prices, AS awards
5. **Priority 5: 60d SCED Gen Resources** - **CRITICAL!** Actual dispatch, base points, SOC
6. **Priority 6: 60d DAM Load Resources** - BESS charging awards
7. **Priority 7: 60d SCED Load Resources** - Actual charging data

## Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Test & Validate API Endpoints
```bash
# Test connection to verify credentials work
uv run python ercot_ws_download_all.py --test
```

**Expected Issues**:
- Some endpoint paths may need adjustment based on actual API
- Column names may differ from expected schema
- Date formats may need tweaking

**Action**: Test with small date ranges first, fix any endpoint/schema issues

### 2. Download Recent Data (Last 50 Days)
```bash
# Start with DAM prices (smallest, safest)
uv run python ercot_ws_download_all.py --datasets DAM_Prices

# Then RT prices (investigate timestamp issue first)
uv run python ercot_ws_download_all.py --datasets RTM_Prices

# Then AS prices
uv run python ercot_ws_download_all.py --datasets RegUpDown_Prices Reserve_Prices
```

**Why**: Recent data is most critical, smallest download, fastest validation

### 3. Verify Downloads
```bash
# Check for gaps
uv run python ercot_ws_verify_downloads.py

# Fix any gaps by adjusting date ranges
```

### 4. Download 60-Day Disclosure Data (280 Days)
```bash
# This will take HOURS due to file sizes
uv run python ercot_ws_download_all.py --datasets \
  60d_DAM_Gen_Resources \
  60d_SCED_Gen_Resources
```

**Warning**: These files are MASSIVE. Monitor disk space!

### 5. Post-Process to Parquet
```bash
# Use existing Rust processor or create new pipeline
# Append new data to existing year-based parquet files
```

### 6. Run BESS Revenue Analysis
```bash
# Verify calculations work with new data
# Compare results to previous calculations for consistency
```

### 7. Set Up Continuous Updates
```bash
# Run every 6 hours for near-real-time updates
nohup uv run python ercot_ws_download_all.py --continuous --interval 21600 &

# Or add to cron for daily updates
0 2 * * * cd /home/enrico/projects/power_market_pipeline && uv run python ercot_ws_download_all.py --batch
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

### ⚠️ API Endpoints May Need Adjustment
The endpoint paths in `downloaders.py` are based on documentation but may need tweaking:
- `np6-785-cd/rtm_spp` for RT prices (verify this is correct)
- `np6-788-cd/dam_shadow_prices` for AS prices (may need different endpoint)
- 60-day disclosure endpoints (verify exact paths)

**Action**: Test each downloader individually and adjust endpoint paths

### ⚠️ RT Prices Have Invalid Timestamp
The verification script detected invalid timestamp in RT price parquet files.

**Action**: Investigate this before downloading new RT data

### ⚠️ Web Service Only Goes Back to Dec 11, 2023
For data before this date, you'll still need the old scraping approach.

**Action**: Historical data (pre-Dec 2023) stays with current process

### ⚠️ 60-Day Lag for Disclosure Data
SCED and DAM disclosure data is released with a 60-day lag for confidentiality.

**Action**: System automatically accounts for this with `get_lag_days()`

- [ ] Monitor disk space during large downloads
- [ ] Test post-processing to parquet

## Support & Maintenance

### Logs
- All output logged to `ercot_ws_download.log`
- Also prints to stdout for real-time monitoring
- Verbose mode available with `--verbose` flag

### State File
- `ercot_download_state.json` contains all download state
- Safe to delete and restart if needed
- Keeps last 100 download attempts per dataset

### Error Recovery
1. Check log file for specific error
2. Review state file to see last successful download
3. Fix issue (credentials, endpoint, etc.)
4. Re-run downloader - will resume from last success

## Performance Estimates

Based on conservative assumptions:

| Dataset | Records/Day | Days to Download | Est. Time |
|---------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| DAM Prices (50 days) | ~36,000 | 50 | ~10 min |
| RT Prices (50 days) | ~100,000 | 50 | ~30 min |
| AS Prices (50 days) | ~36,000 | 50 | ~10 min |
| 60d DAM Gen (280 days) | ~500,000 | 280 | ~6 hours |
| 60d SCED Gen (280 days) | ~2,000,000 | 280 | ~24 hours |

**Total**: ~30-35 hours for complete backfill

**Recommendation**: Run overnight or over weekend

## Conclusion

✅ **Architecture is complete and ready for testing**

The system is designed to be:
- **Reliable**: Automatic retries, state tracking, gap detection
- **Efficient**: Chunked downloads, rate limiting, async I/O
- **Maintainable**: Modular design, comprehensive logging
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new datasets or modify behavior

**Next immediate action**: Test API connection and download 1 day of DAM prices to validate endpoints.
