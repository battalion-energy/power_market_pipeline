## üî¨ Data Quality Assessment

### Tier 1: Verified and Complete (All 474 Programs)

‚úÖ **100% Verified Data:**
- Program names
- State/utility identification
- Program descriptions from DOE
- Source URLs for verification
- Open/closed status
- Customer class categorization
- Program type classification

### Tier 2: Extracted from Descriptions (Variable Coverage)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Pattern-Matched Data:**
- Payment structures: ~20-30% of programs have rates in descriptions
- Time windows: ~60% have time patterns mentioned
- Seasonal info: ~40% mention seasons
- Customer size thresholds: Varies by program

### Tier 3: Requires Program-Specific Research

‚ùå **Missing Data (Clearly Marked "not specified"):**
- Exact payment rates: Many require contacting utility
- Maximum events per year: Rarely published
- Event duration parameters: Not in descriptions
- Advance notice requirements: Varies by program
- Temperature/price triggers: Specific thresholds not published
- Historical event data: Very rare
- Penalty structures: Usually not detailed
- API integration: Not documented in DOE database

## üíé Advanced Research Results (Sample of 20 Programs)

**Prioritization Criteria:**
- Open to new customers
- High-value states (NY, TX, CA, MA, IL)
- Commercial/Industrial eligible
- Has accessible program URL

**Extraction Success Rates:**
- Triggers identified: 20/20 (100%)
- Payment rates extracted: 4/20 (20%)
- Event parameters found: 10/20 (50%)
- Time windows extracted: 1/20 (5%)

**Specific Payment Rates Found:**

*Capacity Payments:*
- Targeted Demand Response (NY): $6.83/kW-month

*Performance Payments:*
- Distribution Load Relief (NY): $1.00/kWh
- Capacity Bidding (CA): $6.00/kWh
- LADWP DR Program (CA): $0.25/kWh

**Why More Rates Weren't Found:**
1. Many utilities don't publish rates on public web pages
2. Rates vary by customer size, location, or contract
3. "Contact utility for pricing" is standard practice
4. Auction-based programs have variable rates
5. Rates embedded in PDF tariff sheets (need PDF parser)

**Goal:** Extract rate tables, terms, conditions from PDFs

### Phase 7: Direct Utility Contact
**Effort:** 4-6 weeks
**Method:** Email/phone campaigns to utility DR managers
**Goal:** Fill gaps where data not published online

### Phase 8: Historical Event Data
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Method:**
