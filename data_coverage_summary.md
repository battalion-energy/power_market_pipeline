## Data Gaps

### Historical Data Needed (Pre-Dec 2023)
To get data from January 1, 2019 to December 12, 2023, we need:
- Implement ERCOT Selenium scraper for MIS portal access
- Download historical files from ERCOT's data products page
- Process approximately 5 years of data

### Missing Real-Time Data
- RT data before August 2024 is not available in the cron job downloads
- Need to implement RT data collection for historical periods

## Recommendations

1. **Import RT Data**: Process the available RT settlement point prices (Aug 2024 - July 2025)
2. **Import Ancillary Services**: Process DAM ancillary services data (April 2024 - July 2025)
3. **Implement Selenium Scraper**: For pre-2023 historical data
4. **Set up Historical Download**: Create script to fetch missing historical files
