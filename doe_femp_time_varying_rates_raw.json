By serving as an intermediary, the aggregators can handle many of the details on the customers' behalf and help them develop load reduction strategies. The aggregators may also offer innovative program features \u2013 for example, by assuming the risk of non-compliance penalties or by allowing customers to participate who might otherwise be too small to enroll directly in the utility's program. BIP participants are also eligible for simultaneously participating in other load management opportunities offered by the utilitie, which allows customers to take advantage of rate credits, reduced energy charges, and incentives associated with both programs, with some restrictions.",

The Load Management Tool enables customers to track the demand of FCU's wholesale power supplier, Platte River Power Authority. Customers can sign up to receive an email during potential peak hours indicating when to shed load. It is difficult to predict when the peak hour of the month will occur, so FCU identifies about 10 potential peak hours per month. Customers on these rates are assessed a coincident peak demand charge of roughly $16/kW in summer months and $12-$13/kW during non-summer months, compared to $10-$11/kW during non-peak hours, for a peak/non-peak difference of about 25%-50%..",

At their discretion, customers can submit bids on a day-ahead basis by indicating the load reduction amount, price (between NYISO's \"monthly net benefits test offer floor\" and $2,000 per MWh), and time period. If a bid is accepted and the customer fully curtails, they receive payment based on the greater of their bid price and the day-ahead locational-based marginal price (LBMP). If the customer fails to fully curtail, they will pay the higher of the day-ahead LBMP and the real-time price for the amount of incomplete scheduled load reduction. Individual customers can either participate directly in DADRP, if their load reduction is at least 1 MW, or through an authorized curtailment service provider (CSP), such as a utility, energy service company, or curtailment aggregator. The minimum offered load reduction by an aggregation of electricity consumers within a load zone must be at least 2 MW. DADRP participants can also be registered in either the EDRP or SCR program.  This program is scheduled to end April 16, 2025. Customers interested in continuing their participation in NYISO's Demand Response programs can enroll in NYISO's Distributed Energy Resources Participation Model.",

Load resources participating in ERCOT's real-time energy market submit bids to buy power up to a specified price level\u00a0and are instructed by ERCOT to reduce load if wholesale market prices equal or exceed that level. Load resources that are scheduled or selected in ERCOT's day-ahead ancillary services markets are eligible to receive a capacity payment regardless of whether they are actually curtailed. A load resource needs to register with ERCOT and must be represented by a \"qualified scheduling entity\" that is responsible for market operations and financial settlement.",

The minimum offered load reduction to the wholesale market is 100 kW and can be achieved by aggregating multiple consumers within a load zone. Curtailment events can last up to four hours or more (however participants must respond for the lesser of the event duration or four hours). NYISO provides two-hour notice of events as well as day-ahead advisories. Participants receive two separate payment streams: a capacity payment and an energy payment. The capacity payment is based on their committed load reduction (specifically, it's accredited value in the NYISO's ICAP market, 64% for 2024, based on the accreditation of a 4-hour storage resource). This accreditation value is subject to change on an annual basis. The energy payment is for their actual cuts during events. Participants face non-compliance penalties if they do not curtail their committed amount when called by NYISO. Individual customers may participate through an authorized \"responsible interface party\" (RIP), which coordinates transactions with NYISO or can act as their own RIP, and cannot commit the same resources in both the Emergency Demand Response Program and SCR.",
