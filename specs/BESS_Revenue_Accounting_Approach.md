# BESS Revenue Analysis: The Correct Approach

## Executive Summary
**We are doing HISTORICAL ACCOUNTING, not OPTIMIZATION.**

Think of this like being an auditor reviewing last year's financial statements, not a trader planning tomorrow's strategy.

## The Fundamental Insight

### What We Got Wrong
We were building an **optimization engine** to figure out how batteries *should* operate to maximize profit.

### What We Should Build
We need an **accounting system** to calculate how much money batteries *actually made* from their *actual operations*.

## The Correct Mental Model

### Like a Bank Statement
```
Starting Balance (SOC):     150 MWh
+ Energy Charged:          -50 MWh @ $15/MWh = -$750
- Energy Discharged:       +100 MWh @ $45/MWh = +$4,500
+ AS Services Provided:     20 MW RegUp @ $8/MW = +$160
= Net Revenue:             $3,910
Ending Balance (SOC):      100 MWh
```

### NOT Like a Trading Algorithm
```
IF price < $20 THEN charge     ❌ WRONG - We don't decide
IF price > $30 THEN discharge  ❌ WRONG - Already happened
OPTIMIZE for max profit        ❌ WRONG - It's history
```

## Simple Implementation

### Step 1: What Did They Do?
```python
# Read from 60-day disclosure
dam_awards = pd.read_csv(f'60d_DAM_Gen_Resource_Data-{date}.csv')
bess_operations = dam_awards[dam_awards['Resource Type'] == 'PWRSTR']

for hour in range(24):
    mw = bess_operations[f'Hour {hour}']['Awarded Quantity']
    if mw > 0:
        print(f"Discharged {mw} MW")
    elif mw < 0:
        print(f"Charged {abs(mw)} MW")
```

### Step 2: What Did They Earn?
```python
# Simple multiplication
revenue = 0
for hour in range(24):
    mw_awarded = dam_awards[hour]['MW']
    price = dam_prices[hour]['$/MWh']
    revenue += mw_awarded * price
    
print(f"Total DAM Energy Revenue: ${revenue}")
```

### Step 3: Track the Battery State
```python
# Just follow what happened
soc = initial_soc
for interval in all_5min_intervals:
    actual_mw = telemetered_output[interval]
    if actual_mw > 0:  # Discharging
        soc -= actual_mw * (5/60)  # 5 minutes
    else:  # Charging
        soc += abs(actual_mw) * (5/60) * 0.85  # With efficiency
```

## Data We Need (All Available)

### From 60-Day DAM Disclosure
- **File**: `60d_DAM_Gen_Resource_Data-{date}.csv`
- **What**: Hourly energy awards, AS awards
- **Use**: Calculate DAM revenues

### From 60-Day SCED Disclosure  
- **File**: `60d_SCED_Gen_Resource_Data-{date}.csv`
- **What**: 5-minute dispatch and telemetered output
- **Use**: Calculate RT deviations and track actual operations

### From Price Files (Already in Parquet)
- **DAM Prices**: Hourly settlement point prices
- **RT Prices**: 15-minute settlement point prices
- **AS Prices**: Hourly clearing prices for each service

## What Makes This "World-Class"

### Accuracy
- Uses actual awards, not estimates
- Tracks real dispatch, not theoretical
- Matches ERCOT settlements

### Transparency
- Every number traceable to source
- No black box algorithms
- Clear audit trail

### Simplicity
- Just multiplication and addition
- No complex optimization
- Easy to validate

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't Try to Be Smart
- ❌ "Let's optimize the battery schedule" - NO, it already happened
- ❌ "Let's predict the best hours to charge" - NO, they already chose
- ❌ "Let's maximize arbitrage revenue" - NO, just count what they made

### Don't Make Up Data
- ❌ Arbitrary price thresholds
- ❌ Assumed efficiency values
- ❌ Fake AS awards
- ❌ Mock BESS resources

### Don't Overcomplicate
- ❌ Linear programming
- ❌ Machine learning
- ❌ Predictive models
- ❌ Optimization solvers

## The Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Data Loading
- Parse 60-day disclosure CSVs
- Extract BESS operations
- Load price data

### Week 2: Revenue Calculation
- DAM energy revenue (awards × prices)
- RT deviation revenue ((actual - DAM) × RT price)
- AS revenue (awards × clearing prices)

### Week 3: Validation
- Compare to settlement statements
- Check SOC feasibility
- Verify against known totals

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- ✅ All revenues from actual data
- ✅ Traceable calculations
- ✅ Matches settlements within 1%

### Should Have
- ✅ Daily/monthly/annual aggregations
- ✅ Per-resource breakdowns
- ✅ Revenue component analysis

### Nice to Have
- ✅ Visualization dashboards
- ✅ Automated reports
- ✅ API access

## The Bottom Line

**This is an accounting problem, not an optimization problem.**

We're calculating:
- What batteries **DID** (not what they should do)
- What they **EARNED** (not what they could earn)
- How they **OPERATED** (not how to operate them)

It's historical fact-finding, not future planning.

## Next Steps

1. **Delete all optimization code**
2. **Remove all mock data**
3. **Build simple readers for disclosure files**
4. **Calculate revenues from actual operations**
5. **Validate against settlements**

Remember: We're accountants auditing last year's books, not traders planning next year's strategy!
