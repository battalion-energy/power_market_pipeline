Tell me about the schema changes that occurred in the csv SCED files that we had to work around over the years. 

‚óè Looking at the code and handling in bess_revenue_calculator.py, here are the major SCED schema changes we've had to work around:

  1. TelemeteredNetOutput Addition (Mid-2020s)

  Line 346-367 in bess_revenue_calculator.py:
  has_telemetry = "TelemeteredNetOutput" in df_gen_raw.columns
  discharge_col = "TelemeteredNetOutput" if has_telemetry else "BasePoint"

  if has_telemetry:
      logger.info(f"Using TelemeteredNetOutput for {gen_resource} (actual metered)")
  else:
      logger.warning(f"TelemeteredNetOutput not available for {gen_resource}, using BasePoint")

  - Early years: Only had BasePoint (ERCOT's dispatch instruction)
  - Later years: Added TelemeteredNetOutput (actual metered output from the battery)
  - Why it matters: Telemetry shows what the battery ACTUALLY did, BasePoint shows what ERCOT TOLD it to do
  - Revenue impact: Using BasePoint can miss real-world deviations and curtailments

  2. SCED Load Resources ResourceName Column (2023-2024)

  The BIGGEST schema change - mentioned in the comments at line 369:

  # Load charging data (NOW POSSIBLE with fixed ResourceName!)
  df_load_raw = pl.read_parquet(sced_load_file).filter(
      pl.col("ResourceName") == load_resource
  )

  - Before (~2022): SCED_Load_Resources file was MISSING the ResourceName column entirely
  - After (2023+): Added ResourceName column, making it possible to track individual load resources
  - Impact: This was CRITICAL for BESS revenue - we couldn't properly calculate charging costs without being able to identify the specific load resource

  3. Ancillary Services Disaggregation (Post-2020)

  Referenced in the AS calculation fixes:

  Old Schema (2019-2020):
  - RRSAwarded (single column)
  - ECRSAwarded (single column)

  New Schema (2021+):
  - RRS split into:
    - RRSPFRAwarded (Primary Frequency Response)
    - RRSFFRAwarded (Fast Frequency Response)
    - RRSUFRAwarded (Ultra-Fast Frequency Response)
  - ECRS split into:
    - ECRSSDAwarded (Service Deployment)
    - ECRSMDAwarded (Manual Deployment)

  The code handles both (lines 656-664):
  (pl.sum_horizontal([
      pl.col(c).fill_null(0.0) for c in [
          "RRSPFRAwarded","RRSFFRAwarded","RRSUFRAwarded","RRSAwarded"
      ] if c in gen.columns
  ])).alias("rrs_mw")

  4. DSTFlag Column Addition (2011)

  From the Rust processor documentation - mentioned in CLAUDE.md:

  Automatic schema evolution handling (e.g., 2011 DSTFlag column addition)

  - Pre-2011 files don't have DSTFlag column
  - 2011+ files include it to handle Daylight Saving Time transitions
  - Rust processor normalizes schemas automatically

  5. Timestamp Format Variations

  The code shows we handle multiple timestamp formats:

  pl.col("SCEDTimeStamp").str.strptime(pl.Datetime, "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S")

  - Some files use different date formats
  - All are in Central Time (America/Chicago) but parsing varies

  Summary Table

  | Year Range | Schema Change             | Impact                                  | Workaround                     |
  |------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
  | 2019-2020  | No TelemeteredNetOutput   | Less accurate actual output             | Fallback to BasePoint          |
  | 2019-2022  | Load ResourceName missing | Couldn't track individual BESS charging | Major limitation!              |
  | 2020-2021  | AS columns disaggregated  | Revenue calculations broke              | Check for both old/new columns |
  | Pre-2011   | No DSTFlag                | DST handling unclear                    | Schema normalization           |
  | All years  | Timestamp format variance | Parsing errors                          | Flexible strptime              |

  The Load ResourceName missing was the most problematic - it made proper BESS revenue tracking nearly impossible for early years since we couldn't distinguish which
  load resource was charging!
