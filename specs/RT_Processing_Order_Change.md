# RT Processing Order Change

## Change Summary
Modified the ERCOT annual rollup processor to process Real-Time (RT) price data **last** instead of first.

## Rationale
RT price data is the most voluminous dataset with:
- 2024: 13,202 files (36.2 files/day)
- 2025: 20,860 files (96 files/day)
- Post-August 2024: Publishing every 15 minutes (96 files/day)

By processing RT data last, we can:
1. Complete smaller datasets first for quicker feedback
2. Allow early termination if issues arise with other data
3. Better manage memory and processing resources
4. Get results from less time-consuming datasets sooner

## Implementation

### Code Change
File: `/ercot_data_processor/src/enhanced_annual_processor.rs` (line 56-64)

**Old Order:**
```rust
let processors = vec![
    ("RT_prices", ...),        // First
    ("DA_prices", ...),
    ("AS_prices", ...),
    ("DAM_Gen_Resources", ...),
    ("SCED_Gen_Resources", ...),
    ("COP_Snapshots", ...),
];
```

**New Order:**
```rust
let processors = vec![
    ("DA_prices", ...),         // Day-ahead prices
    ("AS_prices", ...),         // Ancillary services
    ("DAM_Gen_Resources", ...),  // 60-day DAM disclosure
    ("SCED_Gen_Resources", ...), // 60-day SCED disclosure
    ("COP_Snapshots", ...),     // COP adjustment snapshots
    ("RT_prices", ...),         // Real-time prices (LAST)
];
```

## Processing Time Estimates

Based on observed processing speeds:

| Dataset | Files | Est. Time | When Processed |
|---------|-------|-----------|----------------|
| DA_prices | ~70/year | ~30 sec | First |
| AS_prices | ~70/year | ~30 sec | Second |
| DAM_Gen_Resources | ~15/year | ~1 min | Third |
| SCED_Gen_Resources | ~15/year | ~2 min | Fourth |
| COP_Snapshots | ~15/year | ~30 sec | Fifth |
| RT_prices (2023) | 70 files | ~1 min | Last |
| RT_prices (2024) | 13,202 files | ~10 min | Last |
| RT_prices (2025) | 20,860 files | ~15 min | Last |

Total estimated time: ~30 minutes for full historical data

## Status

✅ **Source code updated** - The change has been made in the source file

⚠️ **Binary not rebuilt** - Due to a temporary dependency issue (arrow-arith/chrono compatibility), the binary hasn't been rebuilt yet. The existing binary at `/Users/enrico/proj/power_market_pipeline/ercot_data_processor/target/release/ercot_data_processor` still uses the old processing order.

## To Apply the Change

Once the dependency issue is resolved:
```bash
cd ercot_data_processor
cargo build --release
```

Or use the wrapper script that documents the intended behavior:
```bash
./run_rollup_rtlast.sh
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster initial feedback** - See results from smaller datasets within minutes
2. **Better debugging** - Can identify issues in simpler datasets before processing RT data
3. **Resource efficiency** - Can monitor memory usage on smaller datasets first
4. **Interruptible** - Can stop processing before RT data if other results are sufficient

## Notes

- The change doesn't affect data quality or output formats
- All datasets are still processed independently
- Gap detection and reporting remain unchanged
- The only difference is the order of processing
