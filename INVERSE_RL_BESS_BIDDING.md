# Inverse Reinforcement Learning for BESS Bidding Strategy

**Learning from Actual Battery Behavior - The Most Sophisticated Approach**

This document outlines a cutting-edge approach to battery bidding that learns from **actual BESS operations** rather than pure optimization. This captures implicit knowledge, risk preferences, and strategic behavior that no optimization model can replicate.

---

## 🎯 Core Insight

**Instead of telling the model what to do (optimization), we show it what successful batteries actually do (imitation learning + inverse RL).**

### Why This is Revolutionary

Traditional approach (what we built):
```
Market Conditions → Optimization (MILP) → Optimal Bids → Revenue
```

New approach (learning from actual BESS):
```
60-Day Disclosure Data (Actual BESS Bids + Revenues)
           ↓
    Inverse Reinforcement Learning
           ↓
    Learn Implicit Reward Function
           ↓
   Behavioral Cloning + Deep RL
           ↓
    Bidding Strategy (Better than Pure Optimization)
```

## 🏗️ Proposed Architecture

### Stage 1: Data Extraction & Preprocessing

**Extract from 60-Day Disclosure:**

```python

    """

    def __init__(self, battery_name: str = "MOSS1_UNIT1"):
        self.gen_resource = battery_name
        self.load_resource = f"{battery_name}_LOAD"

    def extract_daily_behavior(self, date: datetime) -> BESSBehaviorSample:
        """
        Extract complete behavior for one day.

        Returns:
            BESSBehaviorSample containing:

            - Bids submitted (actions)
            - Awards received
            - Actual operations
            - Total revenue (reward)
        """

        # Load DA awards
        da_gen = self._load_dam_gen_resource(date)  # Discharge awards
        da_load = self._load_dam_load_resource(date)  # Charge awards

        # Load AS awards
        as_awards = self._load_as_awards(date)

        # Load RT operations
        rt_gen = self._load_sced_gen_resource(date)  # 5-min telemetry
        rt_load = self._load_sced_load_resource(date)

        # Load market conditions
        prices = self._load_prices(date)  # DA, RT, AS
        forecasts = self._load_forecasts(date)  # Wind, solar, load
        weather = self._load_weather(date)

        # Calculate revenue
        revenue = self._calculate_revenue(
            da_gen, da_load, as_awards, rt_gen, rt_load, prices
        )

        return BESSBehaviorSample(
            state=self._construct_state(forecasts, weather, prices),
            actions=self._construct_actions(da_gen, da_load, as_awards),
            reward=revenue['total'],
            next_state=self._construct_state(forecasts, weather, prices, offset=1)
        )
```

**State Space (Market Conditions):**
```python
state = [
    # Price signals
    'da_price_forecast',          # Our Model 1 prediction
    'rt_price_forecast',          # Our Model 2 prediction
    'spike_probability',          # Our Model 3 prediction
    'as_prices_forecast',         # Our Models 4-7 predictions

    # Forecast errors

    'solar_error_1h',

    # Weather

    'heat_wave_indicator',
    'temp_deviation_from_normal',

    # Temporal
    'hour_of_day',
    'day_of_week',
    'season',

    # Battery state

    # Competitor behavior (NEW!)
    'total_bess_capacity_online', # How many batteries active
    'avg_bess_da_price',          # What others are bidding
]
```

**Action Space (Bidding Decisions):**
```python
actions = [
    # DA Energy (24 hours)
    'da_discharge_mw[0..23]',     # How much to discharge each hour
    'da_discharge_price[0..23]',  # At what price
    'da_charge_mw[0..23]',        # How much to charge each hour
    'da_charge_price[0..23]',     # At what price

    # AS Offers (24 hours)
    'as_reg_up_mw[0..23]',
    'as_reg_up_price[0..23]',
    'as_reg_down_mw[0..23]',
    'as_reg_down_price[0..23]',
    'as_rrs_mw[0..23]',
    'as_rrs_price[0..23]',
]
```

**Reward (Total Revenue):**
```python
reward = (
    da_energy_revenue +
    as_capacity_revenue +
    rt_energy_revenue -
    charging_cost -
    degradation_cost
)
```

---

### Stage 2: Inverse Reinforcement Learning

**Goal:** Learn the implicit reward function that actual BESS optimized.

**Why?** The actual revenue is just one component. BESS may also optimize for:
- Risk avoidance (don't run out of energy)
- Degradation minimization (preserve battery life)
- Market power (avoid moving prices)
- Strategic positioning (anticipate competitors)

**Algorithm: Maximum Entropy IRL**

```python
class BESSInverseRL:
    """
    Learn reward function from actual BESS behavior.

    Uses Maximum Entropy IRL:
    - Assumes BESS maximizes expected reward
    - Learns reward weights from demonstrations
    - Handles stochastic behavior (noise in actions)
    """

    def __init__(self):
        # Reward function parameterization
        self.reward_weights = nn.Linear(state_dim, 1)

    def learn_reward_function(self, expert_trajectories: List[BESSBehaviorSample]):
        """
        Learn reward function that explains expert behavior.

        Algorithm:
        1. Initialize reward weights randomly
        2. For each iteration:
           a. Compute expected feature counts under current reward
           b. Compare to actual feature counts from expert
           c. Update weights to match distributions
        3. Return learned reward function
        """

        for iteration in range(max_iterations):
            # Compute policy under current reward
            policy = self.compute_optimal_policy(self.reward_weights)

            # Sample trajectories under this policy
            sampled_trajectories = self.sample_trajectories(policy)

            # Compute feature expectations
            expert_features = self.compute_feature_expectation(expert_trajectories)
            sampled_features = self.compute_feature_expectation(sampled_trajectories)

            # Update reward weights (gradient descent)
            grad = expert_features - sampled_features
            self.reward_weights += learning_rate * grad

        return self.reward_weights
```

**Learned Reward Components:**
```python
reward = (
    w1 * revenue +                    # Maximize revenue (obvious)
    w2 * soc_penalty +                # Penalize extreme SOC
    w3 * degradation_penalty +        # Minimize battery wear
    w4 * risk_penalty +               # Avoid risky bids
    w5 * market_power_penalty +       # Don't move prices
    w6 * clearing_probability_bonus   # Prefer bids likely to clear
)
```

---

### Stage 3: Behavioral Cloning

**Goal:** Bootstrap bidding policy by imitating expert BESS.

**Advantage:** Much faster than learning from scratch.

```python
class BESSBehavioralCloning:
    """
    Clone successful BESS bidding behavior.

    Supervised learning: state → actions
    """

    def __init__(self):
        # Policy network (Transformer-based)
        self.policy = TransformerPolicy(
            state_dim=len(state_features),
            action_dim=len(action_features),
            d_model=512,
            nhead=8,
            num_layers=4
        )

    def train(self, expert_demonstrations: List[BESSBehaviorSample]):
        """
        Train policy to match expert actions given states.

        This is supervised learning: (state, action) pairs.
        """

        optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(self.policy.parameters(), lr=1e-4)

        for epoch in range(num_epochs):
            for batch in dataloader(expert_demonstrations):
                states = batch.states
                expert_actions = batch.actions

                # Predict actions
                predicted_actions = self.policy(states)

                # Loss: Match expert actions
                loss = F.mse_loss(predicted_actions, expert_actions)

                optimizer.zero_grad()
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()

        return self.policy
```

**Key Insight:** This gives us a good starting policy that **already works** (proven by actual BESS profitability). We then refine it with RL.

---

### Stage 4: Deep Reinforcement Learning Refinement

**Goal:** Improve upon expert behavior (beat actual BESS).

**Why?** Experts might not be optimal:
- They may have constraints we don't have
- Market conditions evolve
- We have better price forecasts (our ML models)

**Algorithm: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**

```python
class BESSDeepRL:
    """
    Refine behavioral cloning policy with deep RL.

    Uses PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization):
    - Stable training
    - Efficient sample use
    - Works well with imitation learning initialization
    """

    def __init__(self, initial_policy):
        self.policy = initial_policy  # Start from behavioral cloning
        self.value_network = ValueNetwork()

    def train(self, environment):
        """
        Train policy to maximize revenue.

        Environment:
        - State: Market conditions
        - Actions: Bidding decisions
        - Reward: Actual revenue (from our reward function)
        """

        for episode in range(num_episodes):
            # Collect trajectories
            states, actions, rewards = self.collect_trajectory(environment)

            # Compute advantages
            advantages = self.compute_advantages(states, rewards)

            # Update policy (PPO objective)
            for _ in range(ppo_epochs):
                # Get current policy probabilities
                new_probs = self.policy.get_action_probs(states, actions)
                old_probs = old_probs.detach()

                # Compute ratio
                ratio = new_probs / old_probs

                # Clipped objective (prevents large updates)
                clipped_ratio = torch.clamp(ratio, 1-epsilon, 1+epsilon)
                objective = torch.min(ratio * advantages, clipped_ratio * advantages)

                # Update
                loss = -objective.mean()
                optimizer.zero_grad()
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()

        return self.policy
```

---

### Stage 5: Competitor Behavior Modeling (VAE)

**Goal:** Model other BESS to anticipate their bids.

**Why?** Clearing depends on what others bid. If we can predict competitor bids, we can adjust ours to clear more often.

```python
class CompetitorBehaviorVAE:
    """
    Variational Autoencoder to learn competitor bidding patterns.

    Learns latent representation of bidding behavior.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_dim + action_dim, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, 256),
            nn.ReLU(),
        )

        self.mu_layer = nn.Linear(256, latent_dim)
        self.logvar_layer = nn.Linear(256, latent_dim)

        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(latent_dim + state_dim, 256),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(256, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, action_dim)
        )

    def encode_competitor_behavior(self, all_bess_trajectories):
        """
        Learn latent space of BESS bidding behavior.
        """

        for epoch in range(num_epochs):
            for battery in all_ercot_batteries:
                state, action = battery.get_state_action_pair()

                # Encode to latent space
                mu, logvar = self.encode(state, action)
                z = self.reparameterize(mu, logvar)

                # Decode
                reconstructed_action = self.decode(z, state)

                # VAE loss
                recon_loss = F.mse_loss(reconstructed_action, action)
                kl_loss = -0.5 * torch.sum(1 + logvar - mu.pow(2) - logvar.exp())

                loss = recon_loss + kl_loss
                optimizer.zero_grad()
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()

    def predict_competitor_bids(self, current_state):
        """
        Predict what other BESS will bid given current market conditions.
        """

        # Sample from learned distribution
        z = torch.randn(num_competitors, latent_dim)
        predicted_bids = self.decoder(torch.cat([z, current_state.repeat(num_competitors, 1)], dim=1))

        return predicted_bids
```
