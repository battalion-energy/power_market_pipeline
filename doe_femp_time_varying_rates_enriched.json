Customers receive a monthly incentive payment or credit based on the size of the curtailable portion of their load, in return for committing to reduce to the FSL when called upon by the utility with at least 30 minutes' notice. The incentives are up to $13.50 per committed kW per month, even if no events are called. There is a minimum curtailment commitment of 100 kW, or 15% of the monthly average peak demand (whichever is larger). Customers are also required to take service under a time-of-use (TOU) or real-time pricing (RTP) rate to be eligible for this program. Requests for curtailments (which can last up to six hours) cannot exceed one per day, ten per month, or 180 hours per year. Participants are penalized a $6.00/kWh for energy usage over their FSL during a curtailment event. PG&amp;E has contracted with numerous third-party aggregators (also known as curtailment service providers, CSPs) who recruit customers to participate in BIP and manage their participation process. By serving as an intermediary, the aggregators can handle many of the details on the customers' behalf and help them develop load reduction strategies. The aggregators may also offer innovative program features \u2013 for example, by assuming the risk of non-compliance penalties or by allowing customers to participate who might otherwise be too small to enroll directly in the utility's program. BIP participants are also eligible for simultaneously participating in other load management opportunities offered by the utility, which allows customers to take advantage of rate credits, reduced energy charges, and incentives associated with both programs, with some restrictions.",

It is difficult to predict when the peak hour of the month will occur, so FCU identifies about 10 potential peak hours per month. Customers on these rates are assessed a coincident peak demand charge of roughly $16/kW in summer months and $12-$13/kW during non-summer months, compared to $10-$11/kW during non-peak hours, for a peak/non-peak difference of about 25%-50%..",

If a bid is accepted and the customer fully curtails, they receive payment based on the greater of their bid price and the day-ahead locational-based marginal price (LBMP). If the customer fails to fully curtail, they will pay the higher of the day-ahead LBMP and the real-time price for the amount of incomplete scheduled load reduction. Individual customers can either participate directly in DADRP, if their load reduction is at least 1 MW, or through an authorized curtailment service provider (CSP), such as a utility, energy service company, or curtailment aggregator. The minimum offered load reduction by an aggregation of electricity consumers within a load zone must be at least 2 MW. DADRP participants can also be registered in either the EDRP or SCR program.  This program is scheduled to end April 16, 2025. Customers interested in continuing their participation in NYISO's Demand Response programs can enroll in NYISO's Distributed Energy Resources Participation Model.",

Participants receive the higher of $500/MWh and the real-time zonal locational-based marginal price (LBMP) for their curtailments. Participation in any curtailment event is voluntary, and there are no penalties for non-performance. An individual customer can either participate directly in EDRP (if it can offer at least 100 kW of load cut) as its own curtailment service provider (CSP) or through an authorized third-party CSP, such as a utility, energy service company, or curtailment aggregator.

Curtailment events may occur up to ten days per month and last no more than four hours per event in the summer and three hours per event in other months. In the summer months, only one curtailment event may be called per day, but the rest of the year up to two events may be called each day.

The minimum offered load reduction to the wholesale market is 100 kW and can be achieved by aggregating multiple consumers within a load zone. Curtailment events can last up to four hours or more (however participants must respond for the lesser of the event duration or four hours). NYISO provides two-hour notice of events as well as day-ahead advisories. Participants receive two separate payment streams: a capacity payment and an energy payment. The capacity payment is based on their committed load reduction (specifically, it's accredited value in the NYISO's ICAP market, 64% for 2024, based on the accreditation of a 4-hour storage resource). This accreditation value is subject to change on an annual basis. The energy payment is for their actual cuts during events. Participants face non-compliance penalties if they do not curtail their committed amount when called by NYISO. Individual customers may participate through an authorized \"responsible interface party\" (RIP), which coordinates transactions with NYISO or can act as their own RIP, and cannot commit the same resources in both the Emergency Demand Response Program and SCR.",
